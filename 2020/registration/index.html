<h2>What does my registration payment go towards?</h2>
<p>Your registration payments help us keep PyCon registration tickets reasonably priced. Registration costs go towards offsetting costs for catering, audio visual, recording, internet, and other miscellaneous costs. By offsetting those costs, we can offer attendees reasonable registration rates and offer a financial aid program to those that need it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the revenue that PyCon generates is used to run the Python Software Foundation. The <a href="https://python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a> runs PyCon, protects the Python trademark, gives out over $300k in grants per year, houses community infrastructure such as <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/"><a href="http://python.org">python.org</a></a> and employs 7 staff <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/">members</a>. The revenue from PyCon helps us support the community in all of those ways. Most importantly, the grants program has international reach and impacts individuals in 62 countries! To read more about what the PSF does and its finances, <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2019/">check out the 2019 Annual Impact Report</a>.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Included?</h2>
<p>Conference registration includes refreshments during the Opening Reception, full breakfast, full lunch, and both morning and afternoon break refreshments on the three conference days Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (April 17-19, 2020).</p>
<p>Tutorial attendees on the Wednesday and Thursday (before the main conference) will be provided with morning coffee, lunch, and break refreshments. <strong>Attendees pay per tutorial</strong> for each tutorial class that they attend, and purchasing a tutorial by itself does not include admission to the main conference. Tutorial registration will open in early 2020. One tutorial will cost $150 and onsite, it will cost $200.</p>
<p>When registration is open, attendees can also book hotel reservations at venues where we have negotiated conference rates. Please be aware of &ldquo;housing pirates&rdquo; and do not book rooms through solicitations. Our staff will never call you to reserve a room. Only book rooms through our registration website. </p>
<h2>International Travel</h2>
<p>We can provide you with an &ldquo;Invitation Letter&rdquo; upon request, in support of an application for a United States visitor visa. The letter confirms that as a registered delegate you are invited to attend by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the PyCon 2020 committee.  Once you have a confirmed registration send an email to <a href="http://pycon-reg@python.org"><a href="mailto:pycon-reg@python.org">pycon-reg@python.org</a></a>  with your registration ID, name, and address to request the letter.</p>
<h2>Hotel</h2>
<p>Listed below are the hotels PyCon has contracted special rates with. When you complete your registration for PyCon 2020, you will be able to book your hotel reservation through our official housing bureau.  This is the only way to get the conference rate listed below.</p>
