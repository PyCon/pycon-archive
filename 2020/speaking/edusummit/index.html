<p><br></p>
<p>We are glad you are interested in giving a talk at the PyCon Education Summit! The event will be held at the David L Lawrence Convention Center on Thursday, April 16, 2020 from 9am to 4:30pm. Registration for the event will launch later this year.</p>
<p>To learn how to submit a proposal, visit the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2020/speaking/">main Speaking page</a>!</p>
<p>This page will give you a bit of history about the Education Summit and information about some expectations.</p>
<p>PyCon does not want expenses to discourage you from submitting a proposal, and offers speaker grants to ensure that anyone can speak at PyCon. When you create a speaker profile, check the box to indicate that you require a speaker grant. This is not seen by the proposal reviewers and does not affect the review of your proposal. </p>
<p>After proposals are selected, we&rsquo;ll reach out to you regarding your needs. We understand situations can change, and are here for you. If you have any questions let us know at <a href="mailto:pycon-aid@python.org"><a href="mailto:pycon-aid@python.org">pycon-aid@python.org</a></a></p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>The PyCon Education Summit was started by Naomi Ceder in 2013. The Summit has become a friendly and rewarding place to share ideas over the past several years, and this year, we are looking to continue the tradition of sharing knowledge while focusing on implementing what we have learned in our collective experiences teaching Python in our schools and communities.</p>
<h1>What to expect</h1>
<p>The Summit is scheduled to run all day, from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm. During the day, there will be two breaks, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. We will also break one hour for lunch. </p>
<p><span class="label label-note"> Note:</span> All speakers and attendees of the Education Summit <strong>must</strong> also be registered for the conference. </p>
<p>This year the Summit has three sessions :<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Keynotes and selected talks (morning)</li><br />
<li>Mini-sprints - collaborative sessions to create meaningful educational content together (afternoon)</li><br />
</ul><br />
We are inviting submissions for both sessions.  </p>
<p><em>In the submission form please indicate the submission type clearly in the beginning of the Title . e.g. Talk:  or Mini-sprint:</em></p>
<p><strong>Session 1: Talks</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for case studies about how teachers and Python programmers have implemented Python instruction in their schools, communities, and other places of learning and calls for action to help evolve, grow and shape the education landscape. <br />
<ul><br />
<li> Have you implemented a program that you&rsquo;d like to talk about?</li><br />
<li> Have you tried something that failed but learned some great lessons that you can share?</li><br />
<li> Have you learned of a tool or technique that helped you teach more successfully OR helps your students learn more effectively?</li><br />
</ul><br />
Then please join us and share your experiences with the education community.</p>
<p><strong>Session 2: Mini-sprints</strong></p>
<p>Action time! We are looking for topics and activities that could benefit from some intensive in-person discussion and hands-on collaboration.  </p>
<p>Some topics may include:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Gathering best practices for teaching specific populations, tools, classroom styles, etc.</li><br />
<li>Drafting open educational content and resources (such as workbooks, exercises, teaching materials) for classroom use</li><br />
<li>Documenting active learning activities across age groups</li><br />
<li>Inventory and cataloguing of Open Educational Resources online </li><br />
</ul></p>
<p><em>What do we mean by ‘mini-sprints’?</em></p>
<p>The &lsquo;mini-sprints&rsquo; will be conducted in small groups.  Your mini-sprint submissions should describe working group activities. Submit an idea for something you’d like a small group of people to work on for 1-2 hours. If you are selected to help host a mini-sprint activity, your role will be to prep materials to get this group started fast and lead them toward a solid deliverable.</p>
<p>These deliverables will be published openly and serve as the basis for more ongoing collaborative development as part of the larger community.  Mini-sprints proposals shouldn’t be panel discussions, training sessions, or discussion-only groups.  These should be ‘mini-sprint’ activities with a well defined need and a planned deliverable. Groups will be created during the event based on the interest of the attendees, and will be around 3-5 people.  </p>
<p>Do you have a mini-sprint need or idea but don’t have someone who can lead the activity? </p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to find a collaborator who can attend and lead the activity.  We’ll be conducting several social media campaigns to solicit ideas and connect people.</p>
<p><strong> Session 3: Lightning Talks!</strong></p>
<p>This is a fun and fast segment and so popular at Education Summit that it gets its own category this year! If you any thing to share , an idea , a demo, an experience related to our mission , do submit your talk.  This is a 4 minute talk and is a good entry point for first time speakers.  </p>
<p>If you are passionate about programming and education, we urge you to submit a proposal to speak OR a proposal for a mini-sprint activity! You do NOT need to be an experienced speaker! We want you to share knowledge; we want to learn from your experiences. </p>

<p><strong>Submit your proposal early!</strong> The Summit committee will provide feedback to talks that come into our system, and we <em>will</em> work with you to improve your proposal to improve your chances of being selected to speak, <strong>however</strong> this is only feasible if your proposal is submitted well before deadline.</p>
