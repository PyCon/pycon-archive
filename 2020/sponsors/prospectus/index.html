<p>PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. PyCon is organized by the Python community <strong>for</strong> the community. It is underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, a 501(c)3 charitable organization set up to manage the growth and development of Python worldwide.</p>
<p>Our conference continues to connect with new community members locally, nationally, and globally. Your sponsorship helps keep PyCon affordable and accessible to the widest possible audience. PyCon generates 80% of the PSF’s revenue. Because of your support, we were able to award $137,200 in financial aid to 143 PyCon 2019 attendees. In 2018, grants were awarded to recipients in 51 countries totaling $324,000.</p>
<p>Benefits of sponsorship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being part of the biggest and most prestigious Python conference in the world</li>
<li>Being matched with those who could potentially become clients or employees</li>
<li>Increasing your brand exposure and elevating your corporate identity within the community</li>
<li>Staying in front of your current and potential customers - 3000+ attendees will see your products </li>
<li>Strengthening your company’s reputation by investing in Python and the open source community</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample sponsorships are below. Depending on your level of sponsorship, packages include complimentary conference passes, booth space, lead retrieval scanners, speaking opportunities, and participation in the Job Fair.</p>

<h2 id=“job-fair-info”>Job Fair Information</h2>

<p>We always have an amazing turnout at our Job Fair. Many companies find good prospects during the three-hour event, some receiving hundreds of resumes in a short time. The job fair is open to the public, with tickets available online. This opens up opportunities to reach the local dev scene, schools, and user groups and increases the Job Fair audience with quality candidates.</p>
<p>Date &amp; Time: Sunday, April 19, 2020 – 10:00am to 1:00pm</p>
<p>Location: Exhibit Hall A — David L. Lawrence Convention Center</p>

<p>Move-out: Begins at 1:00pm. Sponsor material should be cleared out by 3:00pm.</p>
