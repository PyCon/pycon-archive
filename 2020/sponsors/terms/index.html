<h1>Sponsor Terms and Conditions</h1>
</div>
<p><strong>PAYMENT</strong>: Full payment in U.S. funds must accompany this form in order to secure your space as a sponsor or exhibitor.</p>
<p><strong>CANCELLATION POLICY</strong>: We will refund 75% of the total sponsor or exhibitor fee for cancellations received in writing 120 days (December 17, 2019) before the first day of the conference. We will refund 50% of the total sponsor or exhibit fee for cancellations received in writing 80 days (January 26, 2020) before the first day of the conference.<br />
After that date, no refunds will be issued. In the unlikely event of cancellation of the conference, the liability of the Python Software Foundation is limited to the return of paid fees.</p>
<p><strong>DEADLINES</strong>: Company logos, descriptions, banners, advertising pages, tote bag inserts and similar must be provided by the applicable deadlines for inclusion in the promotional materials for PyCon.</p>
<p><strong>GOOD FAITH EFFORT</strong>: All sponsor and vendor benefits will be provided on the basis of a good faith effort on the part of both the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the sponsor/vendor/exhibitor(Sponsor).<br />
The failure of Sponsor to provide a good faith effort to comply with PSF deadlines and guidelines may, in the PSF&rsquo;s sole discretion, result in the revocation of some or all Sponsor benefits without recourse.</p>
<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE</strong>: The PSF shall assign the display space to Sponsor for the period of the display. Location assignments will be on a first-come, first served basis and will be made solely at the discretion of the PSF. Failure to use a reserved space will result in penalties (up to 50% of your sponsorship cost). </p>
<p><strong>USE OF DISPLAY SPACE</strong>: Sponsor is allowed to distribute literature, run demonstrations, and sell products in its assigned exhibit space. Sponsor shall not assign to a third party its display space or any portion of that space without the prior written consent of the PSF, which the PSF may grant or withhold at its sole discretion. If such permission is given, Sponsor shall assume full responsibility for the conduct of the assignee and all its representatives. Sponsor product demonstrations may in no way interfere with demonstrations at adjacent tables.</p>
<p><strong>INDEMNITY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>: Neither the PSF, any co-sponsor or display space provider nor any of their officers, agents, employees, facilities, other representatives or assigns shall be liable for, and Sponsor hereby releases them from, any claims for damage, loss, harm or injury to the person, property or business of Sponsor or any of its visitors, officers, agents, employees or other representatives, resulting from theft, fire, earthquake, water, unavailability of the facility, accident or any other reason in connection with the display at the conference. Sponsor shall indemnify, defend and protect the PSF and hold the PSF, any co-sponsor and space provider harmless from any and all claims, demands, suits, liability, damages, losses, costs, attorney&rsquo;s fees and expenses which might result or arise from Sponsor&rsquo;s participation in the conference. Under no circumstance will the PSF, any co-sponsor or the exhibit space provider be liable for lost profits or other incidental or consequential damages, for any acts or omissions whatsoever, including negligence on the part of the PSF, any co-sponsor or display space provider, whether or not appraised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages or lost profits. In no event shall the PSF&rsquo;s liability under any circumstance exceed the amount actually paid to it by Sponsor for display space. The PSF makes no representations or warranties regarding the number of persons who will attend the conference.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVANCE OF LAWS</strong>: Sponsor shall abide by and observe all laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances.</p>
<p><strong>CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF EXHIBITS</strong>: If for any reason beyond its reasonable control, including fire, strike, earthquake, damage, construction or renovation to the display site, government regulation, public catastrophe, an act of God or any similar reason, the PSF shall determine that the conference or any part thereof may not be held, the PSF may cancel the conference or any part thereof. In that event, the PSF shall determine and refund to Sponsor its proportionate share of the balance of the aggregate display fees received which remain after deducting all expenses incurred by the PSF.</p>
<p><strong>SPONSOR CANCELLATION</strong>: Except as provided under the cancellation policy above, all payments made to the PSF under this application shall be deemed fully earned and non-refundable in consideration for expenses incurred by the PSF and the PSF&rsquo;s lost or deferred opportunity to provide display space to others.</p>
<p><strong>SPONSOR CONDUCT</strong>:  Sponsor and all of its representatives shall conduct themselves at all times in accordance with the PyCon&rsquo;s <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2020/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> . The PSF reserves the right to eject from the conference any Sponsor or representative violating those standards. The PSF also reserves the right to take action against or refuse admission to individuals if the PSF learns of conduct occurring outside the scope of the PSF Code of Conduct which would result in a Code of Conduct violation had they occurred at PyCon.</p>
<p><strong>AGREEMENT TO TERMS, CONDITIONS AND RULES</strong>: By applying to be a sponsor of PyCon, Sponsor agrees to observe and abide by the foregoing terms and conditions and by such additional terms, conditions and rules made by the PSF from time to time for the efficient and safe operation of the conference. The PSF does not make any warranties or other agreements except as set forth above, and the rights of the PSF under this agreement shall not be deemed waived except as specifically stated in writing and signed by an officer of the PSF. If any term of this agreement shall be declared invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, successors and assigns of Sponsor subject to the terms of this agreement regarding assignment.</p>
