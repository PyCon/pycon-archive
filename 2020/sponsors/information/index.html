The cost is $150.00 per license that allows for multiple team members to be signed into or you can purchase additional licenses if needed. More information can be found here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/qpdnjlf">https://tinyurl.com/qpdnjlf</a> </p>

<p>We as a conference provide wifi in all of the conference spaces including the expo. You are welcome to use this wifi at no additional cost, but it is shared with all of the attendees. If you wish to order your own dedicated Internet, please see the David L. Lawrence Convention Center Exhibitor Ordering Guide - <a href="http://www.pittsburghcc.com/exhibitors/exhibitor-services/">http://www.pittsburghcc.com/exhibitors/exhibitor-services/</a></p>
<p><a id="Shipping"></a></p>
<h3>Shipping to PyCon</h3>
<p>We prefer that all shipments be sent to the advanced warehouse instead of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. Please use the RUSH - EXHIBIT MATERIAL label in the exhibitor kit. This helps us ensure that we receive your material in time and that it does not get lost/misplaced. The advanced warehouse is open to receive PyCon packages from March 16, 2020 - April 8, 2020, Monday - Friday from 7:30am to 3:30pm. </p>
<p>Deadline to receive material for PyCon is April 8, 2020</p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note:</span> Shipments to the Tricord warehouse will incur a shipping charge</p>

<h3>Swag Bag Inserts</h3>
<p>It’s important that bag inserts be sent with the specific label of SWAG BAG ITEMS in the exhibitor kit, so that they arrive in time for stuffing. Please send 3300 inserts. When picking your swag bag item, please keep in mind that most people will have to pack the item into their suitcase/backpack for traveling. </p>

<p><span class="label label-important">Note:</span> Shipments to the Tricord warehouse will incur a shipping charge</p>
<p><a id="Exhibition"></a></p>
<h3>Important Exhibition Information</h3>
<p>The Exhibit Hall is located in Exhibit Hall A in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. It is near Registration and in close proximity to all the sessions. Keep in mind that the expo floor opens for the Opening Reception at 5:30 pm Thursday, April 16, 2020. Please have your booth ready and staffed for the event. </p>
<p>The expo floor with booths continues until 5:00 pm Saturday, April 18, 2020. Please use the appropriate shipping labels for your EXHIBITION FREIGHT in the exhibitor kit. We kindly ask that you do not pack swag bag inserts with your exhibition freight since we stuff bags before you get to your booth for setup. Please ship those items separately with the appropriate shipping label. For your booth items, use the advanced shipping labels in the exhibitor kit.</p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note:</span> Beverages and lunch will be available in the “Sponsor Lounge” in the expo hall Please prepare to have your booths staffed from 8:00 am until  5:00 pm. It is mandatory that your booth is staffed for the &ldquo;active times&rdquo; (see below).</p>
<p>Move-in for the Exhibit Hall<br />
  * <strong>Keystone &amp; Diamond Level</strong>: begins on Tuesday, April 14 at 2:00pm - 7:00pm and concludes on Thursday, April 16 at 12:00pm. <br />
  * <strong>Platinum &amp; Gold Levels</strong>: begins on Wednesday, April 15 at 8:00am - 6:00pm and concludes on Thursday, April 16 at 12:00pm. </p>
<h3>Exhibition Floor Times</h3>

Please do not tear down your booth prior to 5:00 PM on Saturday, April 18. It is disrespectful to attendees and to the other sponsors who have committed to staying until the end of the day.</p>

<h3>Accessible Storage</h3>
<p>Onsite storage is $75.00 per skid to store. To access the stored items there is a labor fee that is usually a ½ hour.  Labor does need to be with the exhibitor when they access so that the trailer can be opened.  If there are only a few items to be removed the exhibitor may carry themselves. If boxes need to be moved to the booth area then the labor would need to deliver. See page 16 in the Exhibitor Kit.</p>

<h3>Conference Advertisement</h3>
<p>Keystone, Diamond and Platinum sponsors can submit a high-resolution advertisement for us to display in between sessions on the screens. Please keep in mind our code of conduct when creating these ads. <br />
Due March 2, 2020</p>
