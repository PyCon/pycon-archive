A great web site to visit is Travel Portland: 
[http://www.travelportland.com/](http://www.travelportland.com).
Here you'll find things to do, places to visit, and dining suggestions by neighborhood.

During the main conference, breakfast and lunch are included, so all you have to worry about is dinner. The *real* problem is choosing where to go.  Portland is a town for "foodies" so the possibilities really are endless. 

Many restaurants are easily accessible via light rail and streetcar. Here's a map showing the area around the Oregon Convention Center and some restaurants you can choose from. Please note that these restaurants are a suggestion based on recommendations our staff has received from third parties. We have not (yet) had a chance to eat at all of these establishments to personally advise.

</div>

The Oregon Convention Center is shown on the map with a red marker. The restaurants listed on this page are shown on the map with green markers. Two downtown food truck pods are shown with blue markers.

####A quick note for those interested in shopping
The Lloyd Center Mall is shown with a yellow marker. This is the closest shopping area to the convention center. If you take the light rail (MAX) to downtown, there are many other shopping locations. Travel Portland has created a great guide to shopping in Portland [here](http://www.travelportland.com/article/shopping-districts-and-destinations/). Note that Portland is tax free shopping!

## Immediate vicinity
The Lloyd District contains the convention center, Oregon's largest mall, and the Moda Center. It offers a full menu of dining options. Here are two recommended restaurants: 

* **McMenamins on Broadway**, 1504 N.E. Broadway. - A more mainstream menu with burgers, sandwiches, pizza, salads and rice bowls. Whatever you order, start with a bowl of their Cajun tots, the perfect pair for any of the local chain’s own spirits, craft brews or wines.

* **Altabira City Tavern**, 1021 N.E. Grand Ave. - Atop the roof of the Hotel Eastlund,  you'll find beer-centric fare and breathtaking views of the east side, Willamette River and downtown skyline. Dishes range from a Citizen Baker pretzel with beer mustard and smoked salmon schmear to hearty braised rabbit pot pie or smoked beef brisket — all designed to pair with beer from one of 16 local taps.

## Pearl District
Features galleries and cultural institutions, as well as stylish shops and acclaimed eateries.

Locals recommend:

* **Park Kitchen**, 422 N.W. Eighth Ave. - Nestled in a historic building along the peaceful green swath of the North Park Blocks, James Beard Award-nominated chef Scott Dolich specializes in creating new dishes using local ingredients. 

* **Deschutes Brewery & Public House**, 210 N.W. 11th Ave. - The pub’s distinct Northwest style brings a taste of Central Oregon to the heart of Portland, and its 18 taps feature Deschutes Brewery staples and seasonal favorites, as well as a selection of experimental beers developed and brewed on-site.

## Old Town Chinatown
Home to the famous Portland Saturday Market, Voodoo Doughnut and Lan Su Chinese Garden.

Locals recommend:
