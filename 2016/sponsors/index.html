                                    <p><p>Launched August 2014, we are a fun and friendly user group dedicated to proliferating a diverse and talented Python community in the Puget Sound region. We are devoted to exploring Python-based programming knowledge, embracing those new to Python and experienced Pythonistas from all walks of life, and helping our members to achieve their professional goals.</p>

<p>Currently, we’re pursuing programming to support career building for our members, Python education, and diversity in our membership.</p>

<p>In October we’re launching our first ever career coaching sessions. Over 70 participating members will spend time with five different coaches to discuss approaches to building a career as a professional software engineer. Coaches include founders of fast growing startups like Rover and Offerup, and engineers from companies like Facebook and Twilio. </p>

<p>For our members interested in studying machine learning, we’re collaborating with Dato, Dato founder and Amazon Chair Professor of Machine Learning at UW Carlos Guestrin, and General Assembly to put on study sessions for our members taking a Coursera Machine Learning Specialization. </p>

<p>In our first year, 44% of our speakers were women. Winner of our community favorite talk was Corinne Hutchinson. She spoke on GeoDjango. </p>

<p>Welcome to the Pacific Northwest. PuPPy encourages you to connect with us and help us spread the word that there’s a welcoming community thriving in Seattle. </p></p>

Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined. We aim to bring fresh ideas to classic web development problems.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project will develop a collection of related technologies. The first package from the Pylons Project was the Pyramid web framework. Other packages have been added to the collection over time, including higher-level components and applications. We hope to evolve the project into an ecosystem of well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.</p></p>
