    <div class="description"><p>In recent times, Time Series-Based Machine Learning has been increasingly relevant to the utilities industry. As demand in electricity grows and new forms of electricity usage emerges, so does the necessity to identify load growth patterns in real-time. As such, while Time Series Classification and Clustering is still an emerging field of study in the Machine Learning space, it has been one of the most relevant topics in the utilities industry. Efforts into applying Time Series Classification/Clustering in the utilities space, specifically pertaining to load, are ongoing, with a mix of both successes and failures. Aided by packages such as Aeon and Numpy, experimentation have included classification of existing load patterns through various models such as HIVECOTEv2, DTW+KNN, etc. at various granularities (yearly, monthly, etc.). Other experiments have included transforming load data into frequencies through discrete fourier transform and applying similar models. Some of the challenges faced have included classifying classes with low class priors (few cases in training data), identifying partial time series, and identifying new load patterns in conjunction with existing loads.</p>
<p>This poster intends to highlight ongoing experiments, existing challenges, and the packages used.</p>

    <div class="description"><p>Refactoring is a crucial part of the development process. But refactoring can be <strong>scary</strong>: how do you know that your changes haven't introduced subtle bugs? Perhaps your refactored code now raises an exception in some cases, or has an edge case that returns a slightly different value. Unit tests can help, but what can you do about <strong>unexpected</strong> differences in behavior?</p>

    <div class="description"><p>Machine learning models are powerful and helpful, but their value increases when we understand how confident we can be in their predictions. Enter conformal prediction. Using Python libraries like MAPIE, we can create upper and lower bounds of a prediction interval for point estimates. For classification tasks, we can use the underlying probabilities of algorithms like logistic regression to understand how confident the model is in choosing a given outcome.</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, obtaining a clear measurement of confidence like this allows practitioners to make relevant business decisions, for example. A subscription service may decline to launch a new feature if its underlying model cannot classify user types with high confidence. Similarly, a model that predicts monetary amounts won't be very helpful if the prediction intervals are especially wide and include extra noise.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks like filtering, summarization, and code generation, but their high computational requirements lead to steep costs and limited scalability. This poster proposes a novel approach that breaks from the constraints of monolithic LLMs, moving toward a lightweight ecosystem of open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) coordinated by a central Master Agent.</p>
<p>In this architecture, the Master Agent dynamically assigns requests to specialized Worker Agents, each running an SLMs (Phi3, Orca-mini, etc) tuned for a particular function. By distributing tasks among smaller, focused models, we reduce resource consumption and cost. Scaling up or adapting to new tasks becomes as simple as adding or swapping Worker Agents, avoiding the complexity and overhead of deploying an all-encompassing large model.</p>
<p>Beyond cost and scalability, this approach addresses the growing demand for edge-compatible solutions. Compact SLMs integrate seamlessly into edge devices ranging from IoT sensors to mobile apps which enables low-latency, privacy-preserving, and even offline language processing. This setup empowers developers to bring advanced language tasks directly to the user, regardless of infrastructure or connectivity constraints.</p>
<p>Our implementation, primarily in Python and supported by open-source frameworks like Langchain, Hugging Face LLMs, etc. to foster community-driven enhancements. The poster will showcase how this multi-agent framework optimizes resource utilization, simplifies maintenance through modular specialization, and ensures robust failover for uninterrupted performance. Attendees will learn how to integrate these components into their own projects, benefiting from a flexible, future-proof platform that’s both affordable and adaptable.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Early diagnosis is vital for significantly improving treatment outcomes for cancer patients, as the chances of successful treatment and survival greatly increase when the disease is caught before it spreads. A promising area of research in early cancer detection focuses on tiny, circular pieces of DNA called extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) or amplicons. These DNA circles are produced by tumor cells and can be identified in the blood or tissue samples of patients with various types of cancer. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technology, capable of generating individual sequence reads as long as 100 kb, have made detecting these ecDNAs feasible. As sequencing costs continue to decrease, ecDNAs are now being sequenced from thousands of patients, creating vast datasets that require sophisticated computational tools for analysis.</p>
<p>To address this need, we developed a bioinformatics tool named AmpliconFinder, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on long-read sequencing data from cancer patients with a robust bioinformatics pipeline—all implemented in Python. The tool leverages powerful libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow for CNN development, and pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data processing and visualization. Circular DNA amplicons, which serve as early-stage cancer biomarkers, can be studied using AmpliconFinder, providing a pathway for doctors to harness cost-effective sequencing data for simple, non-invasive early cancer detection, ultimately leading to more effective treatments.</p></div>

This poster presents a Python-based framework for climate model downscaling, using deep learning to bridge the gap between global and local predictions.</p>
<p>The approach leverages PyTorch's neural network capabilities and Python's scientific computing stack for processing complex climate data. The framework combines xarray for multi-dimensional data handling, dask for distributed computing, and custom PyTorch layers optimized for atmospheric pattern recognition. Through MLflow's experiment tracking and Panel's interactive visualizations, we demonstrate how different neural architectures affect prediction accuracy across various regions and climate variables. This downscaling approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 40-65% compared to traditional statistical methods, with correlation coefficients (r²) improving significantly for temperature predictions in complex terrain regions.</p>
<p>By integrating domain-specific libraries like metpy with NumPy's computational capabilities, we showcase how Python enables scalable climate science .Visitors to our poster can explore live examples showing how machine learning improves climate predictions.

<p>However, with the surge of metadata, there are now new challenges with sharing, storing, writing, and integrating metadata into sample analysis due to the lack of metadata handling and standardization. This issue arises primarily because more focus has been given to the actual data rather than both the data and its metadata.

    <div class="description"><p>How do you create a custom design for a woven band in an unfamiliar weaving style? Weaving relies on repeating patterns, so it can be easy to describe how a project should look, but actually picturing it is a different matter. </p>
<p>My goal was to design a band with diamonds, mountains, and other southwestern elements to be woven on an inkle loom. Plain weave on an inkle loom only uses repeating A-B patterns, which doesn’t allow for shapes like a diamond. I wanted to weave with a style where the pattern is built-in when you set up the loom with the warp, rather than manipulated by hand for each row, which is more error-prone. I'd heard of an A-B-A-C pattern style known as Turned Krokbragd, which could work. This weaving style is originally from Sweden, so finding existing patterns for my southwestern USA theme would be unlikely. </p>
<p>This Python project let me visualize my own patterns, try out different colors, and add additional design elements like a border around a central pattern. The prototyping tool creates a more realistic visual by accounting for the physical spacing of the warp threads.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>We write a Python workflow that performs several web scraping tasks to gather future positions of the International Space Station (ISS) and weather forecast data (surface temperature, surface pressure, cloud coverage, etc.) on those positions. We then perform reverse geocoding to identify the countries and oceans of the individual locations. The collected data are combined to create interactive maps where along ISS future orbits, we can pinpoint at any location, the weather conditions and the country (and associated flag) or the ocean. We also plot on the maps the major world cities along orbits. This work can be used by individuals who want to know when ISS will fly over their cities and what will be the weather.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Materials science is traditionally limited by time-consuming experimental methods for predicting new material properties. Our poster demonstrates how machine learning can dramatically accelerate materials discovery through computational techniques. By using Python libraries like PyTorch, DScribe, and ASE, we will simulates and predict material properties before they're physically created.</p>
<p>Imagine designing materials for solar panels, electronic devices, or medical implants through a computational model. Our approach uses neural network to transform atomic structures into predictive insights, identifying patterns that human researchers might miss. We can predict critical material characteristics like mechanical strength, electrical conductivity with unprecedented speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>The poster will help connect computational methods with practical scientific research, providing an interactive demonstration of how machine learning can enhance materials design.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Chess, one of the most iconic board games in history, has a global community nearing a billion players. With the help of powerful chess engines, computers have democratized access to advanced chess analysis tools - tools that even top grandmasters use to analyze and improve their games.  </p>
<p>The good news is that these top chess engines are free, and as Python programmers, we can utilize them to enhance our own chess skills. Chess positions and moves are denoted using standard notations like PGN and FEN, making it easier to analyze and visualize them programmatically.  </p>
<p>This poster will explore how to use Python to:
- Parse chess games using the <code>python-chess</code> library.<br />
- Analyze games with the help of chess engines to identify mistakes and learn from them.<br />
- Visualize games and positions using the <code>chess-board</code> library.</p></div>
