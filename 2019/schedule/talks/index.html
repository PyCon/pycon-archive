1. Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;
1. Python&#39;s set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;
1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.

Boolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.

Python&#39;s set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.

Finally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.

But even if you understand what they do, it&#39;s not always obvious what you can do with them.  Sure, from a practical perspective, they let you remove repeated code from your callables.  And semantically, they let you think at a higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions and classes.

But what can you actually do with them?  For many Python developers I&#39;ve encountered, ecorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a problem.

In this talk, I&#39;ll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while also providing more semantic power.  Moreover, you&#39;ll see examples of things would be hard to do without decorators.  I hope that after this talk, you&#39;ll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own Python projects.">Practical decorators</a>

Cross-stitch refers to the creation of crosses in a grid that combines to build up an image, based on a &#39;chart&#39; or pattern of the intended design.

Even though entire pieces could be created based on completely manual processes, much of the technology behind automating chart creation is locked behind paid software. 

During this presentation, we will discuss how we can leverage the Python Imaging Library (PIL, now Pillow) in order to take source images and turn them into cross-stitch charts. 

The resulting art piece from the talk, the PyCon US 2019 logo, will be auctioned off at the PyLadies Charity Auction. Tickets to the Charity Auction available separately, see website for details.

Despite that, for reasons that we can&#39;t begin to understand, a big part of an incident responder&#39;s job seems to be opening numerous browser tabs and copy-pasting bits of text from one system to another. The hard parts of incident response can&#39;t be automated, but there are entire classes of busy-work that we can eliminate with a few web hooks and some artisanal Python.

In this talk we&#39;re going to discuss how to use Python to automate security incident response team (SIRT) operations. We&#39;ll give an overview of what a typical SecOps/SIRT infrastructure looks like, how and where automation fits in, and dive into some code. We&#39;ll walk through a simple example, with screenshots and code, of automating a SecOps process. We want to show that  getting started with security automation doesn&#39;t have to be difficult or expensive (though vendors will happily take your money). Just a little bit of Python can make some great quality of life improvements for incident responders.">A Snake in the Bits: Security Automation with Python</a>

It&#39;s the small box that has a memory card and an Ethernet cable on one side, and lots of colorful wires connected to the other end. Inside runs the logic that turns inputs from sensors into outputs to robots, conveyor belts and other machinery. PLCs evolved from relay banks in the 1970s and have ruled the world of industrial automation since then.

In the first half of this talk we will take a look at how they work, how to program them, and why a strange language called ladder logic is (still) the lingua franca for programming them. In a short on-stage demo I will write some PLC code to control a device on stage.

It&#39;s 2019 now and just running a PLC isn&#39;t quite enough anymore. Everyone is talking about the Industrial Internet of Things and they have connected their PLCs to the company network. The second half of the talk will look at how we can connect to PLCs to read data and influence the running program with Python. ">What is a PLC and how do I talk Python to it?</a>

Tools like AlphaZero can formulate winning strategies for games given only a description of the rules of the game.  For certain classes of problems, we really can just let the computer do the work.

In this talk, we learn principles, techniques, and multiple examples for three solvers available in Python.

The first tool is a generic puzzle-solving framework that employs tree search strategies.  We apply it to a simple sequencing problem and then to a harder sliding-block puzzle. Next, we&#39;ll look at the solver code to learn how it works.  I&#39;ll also show an essential optimization technique and how to humanize the output.  We demonstrate our skills by solving another famous puzzle.

The second tool is called a SAT solver. It is one of the miracles of the 21st century. From first principles, I&#39;ll show you what problems it solves and the way problems need to be described for modules like *PycoSAT*.  I&#39;ll provide helper functions to humanize our interactions with this great tool.  Then, we&#39;ll demonstrate our skills by creating a Sudoku solver and a readable logic problem solver.

The third tool is the multi-armed bandit. It is a generic reinforcement learning algorithm that is easy to learn, powerful, and applicable to a broad class of problems.  We apply it to winning rock-paper-scissors using pattern recognition.

Lastly, I&#39;ll summarize DeepMind&#39;s paper on AlphaZero which was published in the December 2018 edition of *Science*.  This gives us hints at the full potential of these techniques.

The freedom of having the library write that SQL and give you back a useful, rich model instance (or a bunch of them) instead of just a tuple or a list of records is simply amazing.

But if you forget you have an actual database behind all that convenience, then it&#39;ll bite you back, usually when you&#39;ve been in production for a while, after you&#39;ve accumulated enough data that your once speedy application starts slowing down do a crawl.

Databases work best when you ask them once for (or to do) a bunch of stuff, instead of asking them lots of times for small stuff.

We&#39;ll discuss how innocent looking attribute accesses on your model instances translate to sequential queries (the infamous [N+1 problem][1]).

Then we&#39;ll go through some practical solutions, taken from real cases that resulted in massive speed ups. We&#39;ll cover how changes in Python code resulted in changes to the resulting SQL Queries

Solutions not only for queries, but also inserts and updates, which tend to be less well documented.

Though this talk focuses on SQLAlchemy, the lessons should be applicable to most ORMs in most programing languages. The ideas discussed, and solutions proposed are also valid for any storage backend, not only SQL databases.

These pain-points can be hard to verbalize, and consequently hard to address.  If your unit tests are a PITA, but you cannot explain why, this talk may be for you.

Mocking as a technique has deep roots within OOD and TDD, going back 20+ years, but many Python developers know mocks and patches merely as a technique to isolate code under test.  In the absence of knowledge around OOD and TDD, best practices around mocking are completely unknown, misunderstood, or ignored.   Developers who use mocks and patches without doing TDD or OOD are susceptible to falling into many well-understood and documented traps.

This talk will draw a historical connection between the way mocks are taught today, and their origins in TDD, OOD, and Java.  It will also demonstrate some pitfalls, and provide some guidance and alternatives to mocking and patching (e.g., dependency injection, test doubles, functional style).">Mocking and Patching Pitfalls</a>

En esta charla, voy a comparar algunos elementos de JavaScript y Python, dos lenguajes que muchos principiantes aprenden, y trataré de convencerlos que Python es el mejor lenguaje para aprender si quieres comenzar una carrera como programador. 

Después de esta charla, sabrás los beneficios de aprender Python como tu primer lenguaje, y si ya estás en la industria, podrás ayudar a principiantes a escoger el mejor lenguaje para comenzar a programar. 

Esta charla es para autodidactas o principiantes nuevos a la ingeniería de software, o cualquiera persona que quiera aprender a programar. También es para ingenieros de esta industria que tienen amigos que no tienen un bachillerato en las ciencias de computadoras pero quieren empezar una carrera de ingeniería, ya que personas que trabajan en este sector pueden aconsejar a los principiantes.

What if you could out-source your worries about code formatting, adopt a consistent style, and make your team faster all at the same time?

Come hear about Black: a new code style and a tool that allows you to format your Python code automatically. In the talk you&#39;ll learn not only how the style looks like but why it is the way it is. I will do my best to convince you not only that it&#39;s good but that it&#39;s *good enough*. You&#39;ll see how you can integrate it with your current workflow and how it speeds up your life while making your code prettier on average.

El uso de programación en el análisis y raspado de datos se ha convertido en una práctica cada vez más común en los medios de comunicación brasileños, promoviendo grandes reportajes que no se lograrían sin el uso de estos medios.

El diario Folha de S.Paulo, en sociedad con Google News Lab, promovió un curso de Periodismo de Datos para periodistas de todo el país. A través del uso de Python, el fruto de ese trabajo fueron materias investigativas sobre la falta de secreto de la justicia brasileña y el uso de análisis de sentimientos en Twitter, que tuvieron alcance nacional.

I also suffer from a genetic disorder called Albinism which often results in limited visual acuity that can range from 20/120 to 20/200 in most common cases. With such a low vision it&#39;s extremely difficult to read the computer screen without the use of on-screen magnifiers. In this talk, we will see how a person with adverse visual acuity can thrive and be successful in the field of Software Engineering. We will address the importance and meaning of accessibility for Software Engineers with partial vision and recommend some best practices that are available today. We will also talk about the importance of an inclusive work culture that can help foster creativity and ease ramp up for a Software Engineer with a disability.

Player Pianos that are 100+ years old are awesome artisan artifacts, but they don&#39;t play digital formats very well. This talk will show how we take a 100+ year old technology and marry it to the digital age via Python libraries and precision lasers! 

In this discussion we will cover how we are creating our own Plug-n-Stream Player Piano. We will take a look at the different digital signal processing Python libraries, their functionality, and requirements for converting audio streams to piano playable audio files. After a brief walk through of our prototyped hardware, we will dissect the digital signal processing, converting streaming music to data for the Player Piano. With a real Player Piano in the room we will demo streaming music from our devices onto the piano.

To support this transformation, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build a Python community with critical mass of users, and scale adoption of Python in our business analyst and data analyst workforces.

Python has been envisioned since its early days as a programming language which can be used to create better, easier to use tools for program development and analysis, as well as build a user community around all of the above, encouraging feedback and self-help. [1] In our experience scaling Python adoption amongst analyst communities within a Fortune 500 company, we have found the aforementioned visions true to form - not only is Python a great first programming language for our analysts to learn, it also comes with batteries included and contains many of the data-related tools and libraries which allows our analysts to get productive very quickly.

This talk will highlight our multi-pronged approaches to overcome organizational inertia to build a community of Python users, provide Python and OSS training, and encourage Python adoption (with mixed success). We&#39;ll share what (we think) best practices are out there, and lessons learned along the way.

Over 483 people died due to the flooding caused by the opening of dams and a million people were evacuated. 

I started a website ([keralarescue.in][1]), written in Django. The main purpose of the site was effective collaboration and communication between authorities, volunteers and public. The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days. Within a week, the community united to forge a critical piece of software that saved thousands of lives.

The site initiated as a portal for refugees to request essential resources like food and water and for volunteers to see their needs, all sorted by geographical location. Additionally, we provided direct information for the government and became the official website later on.

The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks. 

The story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.

Plenty: the Zen of Python is not only a solid set of development principles, but the other easter egg is that it’s packed with wisdom about how to build healthy teams. 

In this talk I draw upon my time as an engineering manager of Python-focused engineering teams to tell stories of what the Zen of Python has to teach us about communication and conflict, building inclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological safety.

But this stigma is not deserved. Floats are friends! Friends that have been stuck between a rock and a computationally hard place, and been forced to make some compromises along the way… but friends never the less!

In this talk we&#39;ll look at the compromises that were made while designing the floating point standard (IEEE754), how to work within those compromises to make sure that `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` and not `0.30000000000000004`, how and when floats can and cannot be safely used, and some interesting history around fixed point number representation.

This talk is ideal for anyone who understands (at least in principle) binary numbers, anyone who has been frustrated by `nan` or the fact that `0.3 == 0.1 + 0.2 =&gt; False`, and anyone who wants to be the life of their next party.

This talk will _not_ cover more complicated numerical methods for, ex, ensuring that algorithms are floating-point safe. Also, if you&#39;re already familiar with the significance of 52 and the term mantissa, this talk might be more entertaining than it will be educational for you.">Floats are Friends: making the most of IEEE754.00000000000000002</a>

We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise.

We took advantage of one of Python’s greatest strengths: its flexibility.  We used it to perform the bulk of our data processing with NumPy, created custom utility functions to encourage code reuse, and created custom scripts for interfacing with the institutional data processing framework we worked within.

A lot of Python engineers and data scientists feel the lack of engineering practices like versioning large datasets and ML models, and the lack of reproducibility. This lack is particularly acute for engineers who just moved to ML space.

We will discuss the current practices of organizing ML projects using traditional open-source toolset like Git and Git-LFS as well as this toolset limitation. Thereby motivation for developing new ML specific version control systems will be explained.

Data Version Control or [DVC.ORG][1] is an [open source][2], command-line tool written in Python. We will show how to version datasets with dozens of gigabytes of data and version ML models, how to use your favorite cloud storage (S3, GCS, or bare metal SSH server) as a data file backend and how to embrace the best engineering practices in your ML projects.

It seems, however, that the examples stop at two groups. This begs the questions: should we not be able to do more than simple two-group, case/control comparisons? Is there a special procedure that&#39;s necessary, or is there a natural extension of commonly-used Bayesian methods?

In this talk, I will use life-like, simulated examples, inspired from work and from meeting others at conferences, to show how to generalize A/B testing beyond the rigid assumptions commonly highlighted. Specifically, I will show two examples, one involving Bayesian estimation on click data on a website, and another on 4-parameter dose-response curves.

Failing to do so can have enormous consequences for yourself and your business. In 2012 one improperly deployed feature flag sent a $365 million company into bankruptcy in 45 minutes. So let’s talk about feature flags, specifically in how they can help us with intentional deployment. Feature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we release — but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our feature flags? 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this talk, I’ll go over the best practices which will make your feature flagging program a success. The humble Feature Flag can transform into many different things: release toggle, experiment, kill switch, permissioning and more. I’ll talk briefly about the possibilities Feature Flags open up, and then describe how to use best practices of visibility and accountability to align those different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After this talk, you’ll know what best practices make a successful feature flagging program, and be able to implement them into your current solution to deploy faster and with less risk.

The Python Packaging Authority has been working hard to solve this problem with a new distribution format for compiled Python code, called “wheels.”

In this talk, we’ll descend into the practice of PEPs 513 and 571: arcane scrolls that can equip Python developers with spells to pre-compile applications and libraries in a way that allows most Linux end users to run them directly. I’ll show you how to hex compiled artifacts and source code into the wheel format, harness application binary interfaces (ABIs) to use external libraries, brave the eldritch horrors of the dynamic linker, and bind these all together in the manylinux environment.

Serverless tends to get expensive when databases are involved.... but if your data is static or changes infrequently, you can use serverless tools to provide powerful interactive APIs extremely cheaply.

[Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python tool that provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a Docker container and instantly deploying that container to a number of different serverless hosting platforms.

This makes it a powerful tool for sharing interesting data online, in a way that allows users to both explore that data themselves and build their own interpretations of the data using the Datasette JSON API.

In this session I&#39;ll show you how to use Datasette to publish data, and illustrate examples of the exciting things people have already built using the tool - including a number of real-world data journalism projects.

I&#39;ll also teach people how to use some of the other tools in the Datasette ecosystem:

* [Datasette Publish](https://publish.datasettes.com/), which allows CSV data to be published using Datasette to a serverless hosting account owned by the user, without any engineering experience required.
* [csvs-to-sqlite](https://pypi.org/project/csvs-to-sqlite/), a tool for efficiently converting large numbers of CSV files into a Datasette-compatible SQLite database.
* [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/), a library that lets users create complex databases from custom data feeds in just a few lines of Python code (ideal for working with Jupyter notebooks).

I&#39;ll discuss the philosophy and design behind Datasette, including how immutable SQLite databases make for an impressively scalable solution for inexpensively serving complex data on the internet. Finally, I&#39;ll be exploring how Datasette takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio and the new ASGI specification.">Instant serverless APIs, powered by SQLite</a>

That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory magically. The fact that this happens automatically can erroneously lead us to believe that it is not required to worry about what happens behind the scenes.

Nothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care.

Although these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case. This topic is not a purely theoretical matter nor is it difficult to find its practical applications. In this talk, we will explain why it is something that should matter to us, and we will talk about how to apply the knowledge we have gained to specific problems.">Time to take out the rubbish: garbage collector</a>

After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years, a closed-loop system has been developed to algorithmically regulate people&#39;s blood sugars. After reverse engineering bluetooth sensors and 915 MHz insulin pumps, the system became possible. As a diabetic, I also built this system and saw my sugar values stabilize much more than I could ever achieve doing it manually myself. Now I&#39;m working on contributing back to the projects as well.

I want to talk about this system, from a technical side as well as a personal side. I&#39;ll talk about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. I also want to show how it&#39;s helped me, and what this means for my health now and in the future.

Python&#39;s type system is already widely used for readability, refactoring, and bug detection — this talk will demonstrate how types can also be leveraged to make your project systematically more secure. We&#39;ll investigate (1) how static type checkers like Pyre or MyPy can be extended with simple library modifications to catch vulnerable patterns, and (2) how deeper type-based static analysis can reliably flag remaining use cases to security engineers. As an example, I&#39;ll focus on a basic security problem and how you might use both tools in combination, drawing from our experience deploying these methods to build more secure applications at Facebook and Instagram.">Leveraging the Type System to Write Secure Applications</a>

Slowly, these annotations have emerged from a proof of concept state (e.g., mypy API planning) to becoming a stable feature.

long various parts of your program are executed. Profiling is useful
to understand what makes your program slow and how you can improve
it. After a quick review of deterministic profiling tools and
techniques, I will describe how you can do statistical profiling with
existing packages or write your own from scratch.

Statistical profiling involves occasionally sampling what your program
is doing instead of watching each line or function. A key feature of
statistical profiling is that by using a moderate sampling frequency,
you can profile your production code with almost no overhead. This lets
you find the actual bottlenecks in real use cases.

The core technical focus of the talk is python&#39;s sys module and how it
lets you easily examine a running program. I also describe some tricks
to be aware of related to threading, context switches, locks, and so on.
At the conclusion of the talk, you will hopefully understand how to use
an existing statistical profiler or write a customized version yourself.

We will also see how one can enable local support for their website in Django.

But inheritance comes with some unhappy strings attached. Inheritance, by its very nature, tends to bind a subclass to its superclass. This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance.

In this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition. My intention is not to demonize inheritance, but instead present how to use it wisely in order to improve the design of our object-oriented software so that it’s more flexible and easier to maintain.">The Perils of Inheritance: Why We Should Prefer Composition</a>

As machine learning becomes more prevalent in socially impactful domains like policing, lending, and education these questions take on a new urgency.

In this talk I’ll introduce several common metrics which measure the fairness of model predictions. Next I’ll relate these metrics to different notions of fairness and show how the context in which a model or product is used determines which metrics (if any) are applicable. To illustrate this context-dependence I&#39;ll describe a case study of anonymized real-world data. Next, I&#39;ll highlight some open source tools in the Python ecosystem which address model fairness. Finally, I&#39;ll conclude by arguing that if your job involves building these kinds models or products then it is your responsibility to think about the answers to these questions.">Measuring Model Fairness</a>

CUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. 

There are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. 

For some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.

If you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.

Finally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.

This talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach. ">CUDA in your Python: Effective Parallel Programming on the GPU</a>

And depending on the users, it can be installed on thousands on computers or on a selected few systems. https://pypi.org is our goto place for finding any dependencies and also in most of the time we install binary wheels directly
from there, thus saving a lot time.

But, Python is also being used in many environments where security is the utter most important, and validating the dependencies of project is also very critical along with the actual project source code.  Many of noticed the recent incident where people were being able to [steal bticoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).This talk will take [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how we tried to tackle the similar problem. SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems.

There are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian&#39;s deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.

We use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.
This talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels&#39; sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process.  The final output is reproducible Debian packages.">Building reproducible Python applications for secured environments</a>

Learn why people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about other options for static analysis.  Take a deeper look at why scanning for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup Safety to make it easier.

Based on analysis of the relevant PEPs and other documentation, and strengthened via a series of interviews with core developers and other community leaders, we’ll cover Python governance past, present and future.  Particular care will be taken to explain why the core developers chose the governance model they did, what the new system entails, and how community members can participate in it.">A New Era in Python Governance</a>

In this talk you&#39;ll learn how to use the Eliot logging library to create causal traces of your computation, including intermediate inputs and outputs. You&#39;ll then see how these traces can help you:

* Ensure the computation ran as expected.
* Debug problems that may have occurred far along within your computation.
* Identify and localize performance problems: which parts of your computation were slow, and what arguments were involved.">Logging for Scientific Computing: Reproducibility, Debugging, Optimization </a>

While it encompasses traditional devops areas such as monitoring, metrics, and infrastructure management, it’s much deeper and empowers developers at all levels of the stack. **Observability is about achieving a deep understanding of your software**. This not only helps you localize and debug production issues but removes uncertainty and speculation, **empowering developers** to know their tools and improving engineering excellence. Observability helps developers “understand the narrative” of what’s going on in their software.

This talk is about how we’ve driven adoption of a culture of observability within our engineering culture. We&#39;ll define and motivate for our focus on observability; discuss the tangible tools we’ve built and best practices we’ve adopted to ingrain observability into our engineering culture; and provide some specific, real-world results we’ve achieved as part of this effort.

Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it?

Despite community perception, more than half of Python usage is on Windows, including web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible.

This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform libraries. From simple things like using `pathlib` rather than `bytes`, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work.">Python on Windows is Okay, Actually</a>

The answer is to have a computer *write your tests for you!*  You declare what kind of input should work - from &#39;an integer&#39; to &#39;matching this regex&#39; to &#39;this Django model&#39; and write a test which should always pass... then Hypothesis searches for the smallest inputs that cause an error.

If you’ve ever written tests that didn&#39;t find all your bugs, this talk is for you.  We&#39;ll cover the theory of property-based testing, a worked example, and then jump into a whirlwind tour of the library: how to use, define, compose, and infer strategies for input; properties and testing tactics for your code; and how to debug your tests if everything seems to go wrong.

By the end of this talk, you&#39;ll be ready to find real bugs with Hypothesis in anything from web apps to big data pipelines to CPython itself.
