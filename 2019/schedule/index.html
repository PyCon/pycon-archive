However, what if your style guide was so restrictive that it only gave you single-argument functions and nothing else?  No modules, no classes, no control flow, no data structures, and not even any primitives like integers or regular expressions.  Just functions.  Could you actually program anything at all?    Surprisingly, the answer is yes.   In this tutorial,  you&#39;ll learn how as you work through a ground-up derivation of the lambda calculus in Python.

You will learn nothing practically useful in this tutorial. No packaging. No tools. No libraries. No deployment. No magic Python programming techniques. And certainly learn nothing you would ever want to apply to a real project.  You will, on the other hand, have a lot of fun, be completely amazed, and learn some foundational computer science that is a jumping off point for further explorations of functional programming, type theory, programming languages, and more.

Libraries like Numpy and Pandas have become the de facto standard when working with data.
The DataFrame object provided by Pandas gives us the ability to work with heterogeneous unstructured data that is commonly used in real world data.

New learners are often drawn to Python and Pandas because of all the different and exciting types of models
and insights the language can do and provide,
but are awestruck when faced with the initial learning curve.

This tutorial aims to guide the learner from using spreadsheets to using the Pandas DataFrame.
Not only does moving to a programming language allow the user to have a more reproducible workflow,
but as datasets get larger, some cannot even be opened in a spreadsheet program.
The goal is to have an absolute beginner proficient enough with Pandas that they can start working with data in Python.

We will cover how to load and view our data
and introduce what Dr. Hadley Wickham has coined tidy data.
Tidy data is an important concept because the process of tidying data will fix a host of data problems
that are needed to perform analytics.
We then cover functions and applying methods to our data with a focus on data cleaning,
and how we can use the concept of split-apply-combine (groupby) to summarize or reduce our data.

Finally, we cover the role of Pandas in analysis packages such as scikit learn.
The tutorial will end with a fitted model.

The goal is to get people familiar with Python and Pandas so they can learn and explore many other parts of the Python ecosystem (e.g., scikit learn, dask, seaborn, etc).">Pandas is for Everyone</a>

In this hands-on tutorial, we will learn about Kubernetes and its key concepts, both in theory (we will become familiar with all the things evoked in the previous paragraph) and in practice (we will know how to use them to deploy and scale our applications).

Kubernetes has the reputation of being a complex system with a steep learning curve. We will see that it is, indeed, a complex system, but that it is possible to tame its most essential features in just a few hours.

Good data pipelines can be used to automate and schedule these steps, help with monitoring tasks, and even to dynamically train models. On top of that, they make the analyses easier to reproduce and productise.

In this workshop, you will learn how to migrate from ‘scripts soups’ (a set of scripts that should be run in a particular order) to robust, reproducible and easy-to-schedule data pipelines in Airflow. First, we will learn how to write simple recurrent ETL pipelines. We will then integrate logging and monitoring capabilities. And we will end using Airflow along with Jupyter Notebooks and paper mill to produce reproducible analytics reports.

Often there is no ground truth available for comparison and the end result of the simulation is unknown even to the code developer herself/himself. Often the user-base of the scientific code is small and the work environment does not provide incentives for testing. 

However, there are always parts of the code that are relatively easy to cover by Unit Tests. Scientific pipelines could and should have Regressions Tests, which ensure that previously developed software still performs after changes in the code, or in external libraries and computational environment. An automatic test suite should not be a burden and can become a game-changer even for a small programming project.

This tutorial is meant to be an introduction to testing in general and to pytest library. Pytest is a full feature tool to test the Python code, it offers a simple way to get started and scales from simple unit testing to complex functional testing. We will begin with simple assert statements and finish with pytest.fixture and pytest.parametrization. The tutorial will also cover a simple integration of the tests suit with Continuous Integration platforms using GitHub and Travis/CircleCI.

**Audience:** The tutorial is designed for scientist and data scientists who would like incorporate testing to their everyday work. We expect that people know basic Python and NumPy, and are familiar with simple shell commands. Basic knowledge of Git/GitHub will be useful in the second half of the tutorial.

&gt; This tutorial will not make you an expert in Machine Learning but will cover enough things to acquaint, enable and empower you to understand, explore and exploits the concept and idea behind it.

----------

**We&#39;ll be learning by generating our own data with bare minimal data points (5 - 10) so that we can manually verify our machine learning algorithms to understand it better.**

_This will also help us to see how changes in data can impact our Machine Learning Algorithms.  At the end of this tutorial, we&#39;ll also be using one real-world Dataset and play with it._

----------

_In this tutorial, I&#39;ll be covering at least 3 well-known ML algorithms(KNN, Linear and Logistic Regression) along with all the maths behind it. We&#39;ll end the tutorial with a real-world mapping application_

_There is no major prerequisite for attending this, you just need to know the basics of python language and I&#39;ll cover the rest. We&#39;ll be using Scikit Learn for simplicity purpose, again, you don&#39;t need to have any prior experience with Scikit Learn or for that matter with Machine Learning_

In this tutorial we will introduce you to the latest developement in IPython and Jupyter, get you up to speed on how to install jupyter on your machine and where to seek help for larger deployment. Then we will dive into intermediate features that makes the power of IPython and Jupyter. 

We will dive into how to make the best use of features like 


 * Async REPL (New in IPython 7)
 * And how to tie that into the Visualisation capabilities of Jupyter, and the new JupyterLab interface.
 * Widgets (building simple interactive dashboards based on ipywidgets)
 * Magics
 * Multilanguage integration,

The notebooks also allow for code in multiple languages allowing to mix Python with Cython, C, R and other programming languages to access features hard to obtain from Python.

Maybe you&#39;re building a rich web experience, like a single page app using JavaScript and a framework like React, Angular or Vue. Maybe you have multiple clients besides web on mobile platforms like iOS or Android. Maybe you have an external facing public API for use by clients with many diverse needs. One things is for sure: you need a robust API.

That API should be able to evolve over time to meet the growing and changing demands of the business and your clients. The frameworks and paradigms we choose as we develop any software can help or hinder that change. A well-designed GraphQL API enables flexibility and stability across changes, as well as easy service discovery and thinner clients with less responsibilities, ensuring that your application grows successfully over time.

The tutorial will focus on building a GraphQL API using the __Python__ library __Graphene__ with a __Django__ backend as a vehicle for teaching the principals of evolutionary API that can be applied across any tech stack, including REST, as well as the more practical concerns of working with __Graphene__ and designing your API for GraphQL.

A frontend, built using __JavaScript__ with __React__ and the __Apollo__ GraphQL client library, will be made available so users can understand the full-stack considerations of building this API and reacting to evolving concerns over time. Writing JavaScript will not be required, but being comfortable reading it and setting up a local environment will help get more out of this tutorial.

We&#39;ll attempt to answer questions such as:

- When is using GraphQL for an API most effective?
- How do I get started with GraphQL in Python?
- What does it mean for an API to be Relay-compliant? What benefits are there? Drawbacks if we don&#39;t comply?
- How can we make use of field arguments for sorting, filtering and other concerns?
- What kinds of changes are safe to make to my API as clients begin consuming it?
- How can I ensure my GraphQL API performs well and we avoid the dreaded _N+1 As A Service_ problem?
- How should I design mutation responses for my GraphQL API to serve client needs?
- How can multiple stakeholders decide how to evolve the API together?">Building Evolutionary API with GraphQL and Python</a>

                                    <a href="/2019/schedule/presentation/86/" title="Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory. Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics. Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.

Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages
for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce
program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start? This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria. You will experience that one&#39;s gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.

The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.

Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.

## Software Requirements

You will need Python 3.7 installed on your laptop. Python 2.7 or 3.5/3.6
should also work. Python 3.x is strongly preferred.
You may use Python 3.8 if is released at the time of the tutorial and all
dependencies can be installed.

### JupyterLab

I will use a JupyterLab for the tutorial because it makes a very good
teaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,
REPL. If you also like to use a JupyterLab, I recommend `conda` for
easy installation. Similarly to `virtualenv`, `conda` allows creating isolated
environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install `Jupyter` via `conda`:

1. Use [Minconda][1]. This is a  small install and (after you installed it)
   you can use the command  `conda` to create an environment:
  `conda create -n pycon2019 python=3.7`
   Now you can change into this environment:
   `conda activate pycon2019`. The prompt should change to `(pycon2019)`.
   Now you can install JupyterLab: `conda install jupyterlab`.

2. Install [Anaconda][2] and you are ready to go if you don&#39;t mind installing
   lots of packages from the scientific field.

Personally, I prefer the Miniconda approach.


### Working witch ``conda`` environments

After creating a new environment, the system might still work with some
stale settings. Even when the command ``which`` tells you that you are using an
executable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.
If you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,
use ``hash -r`` and try again.

[2]: https://www.anaconda.com/download/


### Tools

You can install these with ``conda`` or ``pip`` (in the active ``conda`` environment):

* [SnakeViz][3]
* [line_profiler][4]
* [Pympler][5]
* [memory_profiler][6]




#### Linux

Using the package manager of your OS is alternative if you prefer this approach.

Between the OWASP Top 10, CSRF, stealing sessions, and DDOS attacks, have you ever felt that the world of web security was too complex to understand?  Do you find yourself wishing that you understood what those acronyms *really* translate to in a live web application?

If so, then this is the tutorial you&#39;ve been waiting for.  In this tutorial, we&#39;ll cover essential topics in web security, including the majority of the OWASP Top 10, but we *won&#39;t* be doing it in a theoretical manner.  We&#39;ll take a live, deliberately insecure web application, identify the vulnerabilities, exploit them, and finally fix them.  Sound cool?  It is!

Topics include the following:

* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
* Cookies and how they can be abused
* Why default passwords are dangerous
* Improper authorization checking
* Incorrect Session Management
* SQL Injection
* How to abuse Pickle
* And more!

You&#39;ll also learn next steps and we&#39;ll provide suggested resources for continuing your security education.

In this tutorial, we will introduce PyTorch as a tool to build and experiment with various modern NLP techniques by building deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (biLSTMs).

We will cover a wide range of topics with the purpose of providing participants with enough fundamental knowledge and skills to be able to apply modern NLP to real-world problems using PyTorch. Some concepts and topics include but not limited to data loaders, vectorization, computation graphs, sentiment analysis, fine-grained emotion classification, and neural machine translation.

Nowadays, it is just not enough to arbitrarily train a model and deploy it for production use without properly debugging it. This tutorial also aims to provide hands-on examples and well-organized exercises that teach students how to properly test, train and evaluate NLP models using best practices. Once models are properly trained and evaluated they will be efficiently transformed, stored, and then restored to obtain inferences from real-world, natural language data.

Even if you are a seasoned Python wizard it takes some effort to get your bearings when working with geographical data.  In this workshop, we&#39;ll start with some beginner projects to build geospatial applications.

- How to identify the location of an image file with PIL
- How to find places on a map with NLTK
- How to read/write geospatial file types with tools like geopandas
- How to visualize point clouds from GPS traces or LiDAR data with PPTK
- How to store and query vector tiles with XYZ

By the end of our time together you will have gone from Hello World to having a roadmap for where to learn more about geospatial tools and techniques.

In this talk, you will learn how we created proxy labels for recurrent transactions using python and Apache Spark. Some examples of recurring transactions are Netflix and Spotify subscriptions. The best part about the approach we used is that it did not require paying humans to manually create labels, saving both time and money while increasing accuracy since it bypasses human error.

Because of the robustness of the proxy labels created, we were able to improve upon a previously rule-based process for determining recurring transactions. This ensures that customers do not experience interruption when their card is replaced and they are notified when subscription costs increase significantly, among many other benefits.

### Abstract

#### Audience

The target audience is machine learning engineers, data scientists, and finance/banking folks. However, anyone with an interest in machine learning or banking will benefit from the talk.

#### Objectives

The audience will come away with an understanding of an approach to create labels for unlabeled data and get exposure to a situation in which python and Apache Spark provide business value.

#### Notes

The project has evolved greatly since this article was written, but still provides useful context for understanding value proposition of predicting recurring transactions.

In our tutorial, we&#39;ll present some fundamental rules of software performance as a set of physical, intuitive laws, with illustrative examples. Our goal is for every audience member to leave with enough of a grounding in these underlying laws to make rational performance decisions when selecting their programming tools, algorithms, and hardware.

Audience:
This tutorial is intended for audiences without a computer science background, or those with a computer science background who are interested in discussing and explaining performance concepts to those without it. Some programming experience in Python will be helpful, as will access to the tutorial notebooks and the ability to run them live. Mathematics will be discussed, but will not be required beyond a high school level to understand and engage.

Continuing with tradition, our sponsor workshop session features three awesome half-hour Python tech talks at they relate to Google. Hear about Python tools we’ve built in-house, using Python with Google developer tools to build your web &amp; mobile applications with, or best practices on how we use Python internally at Google. You’re invited to stop by and hear from a cadre of world-class Google engineers from around the world! :-) 

1- What’s New with TensorFlow 2.0

Speaker: Brad Miro, Google, New York

Abstract

Learn about the updates being made to TensorFlow in its 2.0 version. We’ll give an overview of what’s available in the new version as well as do a deep dive into an example using its central high-level API, Keras. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of how you can get started building machine learning models in Python with TensorFlow 2.0 as well as the other exciting available features!

2 - Extreme Python Operator Overloading using AST Manipulation

Speaker: Brian Lee, Google, Cambridge

Abstract

Python&#39;s `__add__, __iter__, __getitem__, __enter__`, and other magic dunder methods grant extraordinary flexibility in constructing new libraries and domain-specific languages on top of Python. It&#39;s very easy to create new context managers, overload object slicing, implement custom initializers/destructors, and more. With this power, library authors have wrapped C libraries like libxml2 (lxml) or blas/lapack (NumPy) with more Pythonic APIs.

However, there are core Python features and syntax that can&#39;t be overridden, like for/while loops, conditionals, and built-ins like zip and enumerate. It&#39;s not even obvious how these should be defined, since they can&#39;t be defined on a per-class basis like every other dunder method.

In this talk, we&#39;ll discuss how to use AST manipulation to override the behavior of Python control flow and other builtins, and why one might want to do such a thing. These AST manipulation utilities are used by TensorFlow&#39;s AutoGraph functionality, which we&#39;ll briefly discuss.

3 - Ask a Google Engineer Anything

Moderator: Wesley Chun, Google, Sunnyvale

Abstract

This is an AMA session, giving all of you a chance to ask a Google engineer burning questions on your minds. That doesn’t mean we’ll be able to answer, however we’ll do our best! First popularized at OSCON back in 2010 then debuting at PyCon in 2013, these sessions are useful in helping developers become familiar with Alphabet, Googlers, their roles, products, and technologies, as well as be able answer technical questions that have them curious. It&#39;s been over 6 years since that first one at PyCon so it&#39;s about that time again. For half-hour, we’ll corral as many Googlers as we can get at PyCon to participate in this informative yet entertaining Q&amp;A session.

Through the lens of The Carpentries, an organization dedicated to teaching foundational coding and data science skills worldwide, we present best practices and opportunities for improvement in computational teaching pedagogy. Evidence-based teaching practices, “train-the-trainer” programs, and mentoring are three strategies we outline that support inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching.

We will share methods to increase student engagement and aid the transition to Python. We used “Unplugged” activities that complement programming fundamentals, “block-based” logic in Scratch, and the drag-to-text Python platform in Codesters. We will also share examples of leading discussions that build girls’ curiosity about technology fields, including learning about role models of top women in the industry, and learning about emerging areas in technology.

Additionally, organizing clubs for students from diverse backgrounds, with varying technical educations, can involve bridging gaps and encouraging community involvement. We’ll discuss methods of reaching families and local communities, such as open presentations, celebrations, and share some do&#39;s and don&#39;ts from our experiences. We’ll also share ways to encourage participants to develop communication skills about their technical work and teamwork.

Adopting Python as our programming language has really helped because of its unique qualities which made it easily accessible and easy to teach/learn. However, providing enough computing devices to the increasing number of students has been a serious challenge. This is even more frustrating when one require to involve online classroom submission/evaluation of assignments. I have overcome this challenge by adopting QPython in smartphones which are rapidly penetrating Africa. With a built-in math library and possibility to install Numpy, QPython in smartphones has made the teaching/learning to more students more efficient especially as they can now engage in learning programming anywhere, anytime and anyhow. The success made me extend it to one of our current projects under the Python African Computational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSETPro) on teaching Python to students, new beginners as well as expert programmers in science and engineering (S &amp; E).   In this talk, I gave a captivating account on how to use QPython to teach computational approaches in S &amp; E in a manner that advancing to normal computing systems is straightforward. Highly excited by the success so far, our outlook is having both Matplotlib  and QVPython in smartphones. This will be a boon for teaching/learning computational approaches anywhere, anytime and anyhow.">Adopting QPython in smartphones for teaching/learning  computational science and engineering</a>

1. Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;
1. Python&#39;s set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;
1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.

Boolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.

Python&#39;s set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.

Finally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.

But even if you understand what they do, it&#39;s not always obvious what you can do with them.  Sure, from a practical perspective, they let you remove repeated code from your callables.  And semantically, they let you think at a higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions and classes.

But what can you actually do with them?  For many Python developers I&#39;ve encountered, ecorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a problem.

In this talk, I&#39;ll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while also providing more semantic power.  Moreover, you&#39;ll see examples of things would be hard to do without decorators.  I hope that after this talk, you&#39;ll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own Python projects.">Practical decorators</a>

Even though entire pieces could be created based on completely manual processes, much of the technology behind automating chart creation is locked behind paid software. 

During this presentation, we will discuss how we can leverage the Python Imaging Library (PIL, now Pillow) in order to take source images and turn them into cross-stitch charts.

It&#39;s the small box that has a memory card and an Ethernet cable on one side, and lots of colorful wires connected to the other end. Inside runs the logic that turns inputs from sensors into outputs to robots, conveyor belts and other machinery. PLCs evolved from relay banks in the 1970s and have ruled the world of industrial automation since then.

In the first half of this talk we will take a look at how they work, how to program them, and why a strange language called ladder logic is (still) the lingua franca for programming them. In a short on-stage demo I will write some PLC code to control a device on stage.

It&#39;s 2019 now and just running a PLC isn&#39;t quite enough anymore. Everyone is talking about the Industrial Internet of Things and they have connected their PLCs to the company network. The second half of the talk will look at how we can connect to PLCs to read data and influence the running program with Python. ">What is a PLC and how do I talk Python to it?</a>

Tools like AlphaZero can formulate winning strategies for games given only a description of the rules of the game.  For certain classes of problems, we really can just let the computer do the work.

In this talk, we learn principles, techniques, and multiple examples for three solvers available in Python.

The first tool is a generic puzzle-solving framework that employs tree search strategies.  We apply it to a simple sequencing problem and then to a harder sliding-block puzzle. Next, we&#39;ll look at the solver code to learn how it works.  I&#39;ll also show an essential optimization technique and how to humanize the output.  We demonstrate our skills by solving another famous puzzle.

The second tool is called a SAT solver. It is one of the miracles of the 21st century. From first principles, I&#39;ll show you what problems it solves and the way problems need to be described for modules like *PycoSAT*.  I&#39;ll provide helper functions to humanize our interactions with this great tool.  Then, we&#39;ll demonstrate our skills by creating a Sudoku solver and a readable logic problem solver.

The third tool is the multi-armed bandit. It is a generic reinforcement learning algorithm that is easy to learn, powerful, and applicable to a broad class of problems.  We apply it to winning rock-paper-scissors using pattern recognition.

Lastly, I&#39;ll summarize DeepMind&#39;s paper on AlphaZero which was published in the December 2018 edition of *Science*.  This gives us hints at the full potential of these techniques.

The freedom of having the library write that SQL and give you back a useful, rich model instance (or a bunch of them) instead of just a tuple or a list of records is simply amazing.

But if you forget you have an actual database behind all that convenience, then it&#39;ll bite you back, usually when you&#39;ve been in production for a while, after you&#39;ve accumulated enough data that your once speedy application starts slowing down do a crawl.

Databases work best when you ask them once for (or to do) a bunch of stuff, instead of asking them lots of times for small stuff.

We&#39;ll discuss how innocent looking attribute accesses on your model instances translate to sequential queries (the infamous [N+1 problem][1]).

Then we&#39;ll go through some practical solutions, taken from real cases that resulted in massive speed ups. We&#39;ll cover how changes in Python code resulted in changes to the resulting SQL Queries

Solutions not only for queries, but also inserts and updates, which tend to be less well documented.

Though this talk focuses on SQLAlchemy, the lessons should be applicable to most ORMs in most programing languages. The ideas discussed, and solutions proposed are also valid for any storage backend, not only SQL databases.

These pain-points can be hard to verbalize, and consequently hard to address.  If your unit tests are a PITA, but you cannot explain why, this talk may be for you.

Mocking as a technique has deep roots within OOD and TDD, going back 20+ years, but many Python developers know mocks and patches merely as a technique to isolate code under test.  In the absence of knowledge around OOD and TDD, best practices around mocking are completely unknown, misunderstood, or ignored.   Developers who use mocks and patches without doing TDD or OOD are susceptible to falling into many well-understood and documented traps.

This talk will draw a historical connection between the way mocks are taught today, and their origins in TDD, OOD, and Java.  It will also demonstrate some pitfalls, and provide some guidance and alternatives to mocking and patching (e.g., dependency injection, test doubles, functional style).">Mocking and Patching Pitfalls</a>

Esta charla es para autodidactas o principiantes nuevos a la ingeniería de software, o cualquiera persona que quiera aprender a programar. También es para ingenieros de esta industria que tienen amigos que no tienen un bachillerato en las ciencias de computadoras pero quieren empezar una carrera de ingeniería, ya que personas que trabajan en este sector pueden aconsejar a los principiantes.

But code evolves over time, requirements change and codebases can get messy and complicated quickly.

In this talk, you will learn how to use `wily` to measure and graph how complicated your Python code is and a series of practical techniques to simplify it. `wily` will show you which parts of your projects are becoming or have become hard to maintain and need a refactor. Once you know where the skeletons are, you will learn practical techniques for refactoring complex code and some resources to use to take your refactoring to the next level.">Wily Python: Writing simpler and more maintainable Python</a>

En las redacciones, las viejas planillas no siempre dan cuenta, y el uso de la programación es cada vez más necesario en la búsqueda de la información.

El uso de programación en el análisis y raspado de datos se ha convertido en una práctica cada vez más común en los medios de comunicación brasileños, promoviendo grandes reportajes que no se lograrían sin el uso de estos medios.

El diario Folha de S.Paulo, en sociedad con Google News Lab, promovió un curso de Periodismo de Datos para periodistas de todo el país. A través del uso de Python, el fruto de ese trabajo fueron materias investigativas sobre la falta de secreto de la justicia brasileña y el uso de análisis de sentimientos en Twitter, que tuvieron alcance nacional.

With such a low vision it&#39;s extremely difficult to read the computer screen without the use of on-screen magnifiers. In this talk, we will see how a person with adverse visual acuity can thrive and be successful in the field of Software Engineering. We will address the importance and meaning of accessibility for Software Engineers with partial vision and recommend some best practices that are available today. We will also talk about the importance of an inclusive work culture that can help foster creativity and ease ramp up for a Software Engineer with a disability.

With a real Player Piano in the room we will demo streaming music from our devices onto the piano.

To support this transformation, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build a Python community with critical mass of users, and scale adoption of Python in our business analyst and data analyst workforces.

Python has been envisioned since its early days as a programming language which can be used to create better, easier to use tools for program development and analysis, as well as build a user community around all of the above, encouraging feedback and self-help. [1] In our experience scaling Python adoption amongst analyst communities within a Fortune 500 company, we have found the aforementioned visions true to form - not only is Python a great first programming language for our analysts to learn, it also comes with batteries included and contains many of the data-related tools and libraries which allows our analysts to get productive very quickly.

This talk will highlight our multi-pronged approaches to overcome organizational inertia to build a community of Python users, provide Python and OSS training, and encourage Python adoption (with mixed success). We&#39;ll share what (we think) best practices are out there, and lessons learned along the way.

I started a website ([keralarescue.in][1]), written in Django. The main purpose of the site was effective collaboration and communication between authorities, volunteers and public. The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days. Within a week, the community united to forge a critical piece of software that saved thousands of lives.

The site initiated as a portal for refugees to request essential resources like food and water and for volunteers to see their needs, all sorted by geographical location. Additionally, we provided direct information for the government and became the official website later on.

The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks. 

The story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.

Plenty: the Zen of Python is not only a solid set of development principles, but the other easter egg is that it’s packed with wisdom about how to build healthy teams. 

In this talk I draw upon my time as an engineering manager of Python-focused engineering teams to tell stories of what the Zen of Python has to teach us about communication and conflict, building inclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological safety. Come ready to reflect on and feel inspired by a new interpretation of these principles, and bring what you learn back to your meetup, study group, open source project, or team.

But this stigma is not deserved. Floats are friends! Friends that have been stuck between a rock and a computationally hard place, and been forced to make some compromises along the way… but friends never the less!

In this talk we&#39;ll look at the compromises that were made while designing the floating point standard (IEEE754), how to work within those compromises to make sure that `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` and not `0.30000000000000004`, how and when floats can and cannot be safely used, and some interesting history around fixed point number representation.

This talk is ideal for anyone who understands (at least in principle) binary numbers, anyone who has been frustrated by `nan` or the fact that `0.3 == 0.1 + 0.2 =&gt; False`, and anyone who wants to be the life of their next party.

This talk will _not_ cover more complicated numerical methods for, ex, ensuring that algorithms are floating-point safe. Also, if you&#39;re already familiar with the significance of 52 and the term mantissa, this talk might be more entertaining than it will be educational for you.">Floats are Friends: making the most of IEEE754.00000000000000002</a>

We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise.

We took advantage of one of Python’s greatest strengths: its flexibility.  We used it to perform the bulk of our data processing with NumPy, created custom utility functions to encourage code reuse, and created custom scripts for interfacing with the institutional data processing framework we worked within.

A lot of Python engineers and data scientists feel the lack of engineering practices like versioning large datasets and ML models, and the lack of reproducibility. This lack is particularly acute for engineers who just moved to ML space.

We will discuss the current practices of organizing ML projects using traditional open-source toolset like Git and Git-LFS as well as this toolset limitation. Thereby motivation for developing new ML specific version control systems will be explained.

Data Version Control or [DVC.ORG][1] is an [open source][2], command-line tool written in Python. We will show how to version datasets with dozens of gigabytes of data and version ML models, how to use your favorite cloud storage (S3, GCS, or bare metal SSH server) as a data file backend and how to embrace the best engineering practices in your ML projects.

It seems, however, that the examples stop at two groups. This begs the questions: should we not be able to do more than simple two-group, case/control comparisons? Is there a special procedure that&#39;s necessary, or is there a natural extension of commonly-used Bayesian methods?

In this talk, I will use life-like, simulated examples, inspired from work and from meeting others at conferences, to show how to generalize A/B testing beyond the rigid assumptions commonly highlighted. Specifically, I will show two examples, one involving Bayesian estimation on click data on a website, and another on 4-parameter dose-response curves. 

There will be plenty of code from the modern PyData stack, involving the use of PyMC3, pandas, holoviews, and more. ">Beyond Two Groups: Generalized Bayesian A/B[/C/D/E...] Testing</a>

Failing to do so can have enormous consequences for yourself and your business. In 2012 one improperly deployed feature flag sent a $365 million company into bankruptcy in 45 minutes. So let’s talk about feature flags, specifically in how they can help us with intentional deployment. Feature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we release — but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our feature flags? 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this talk, I’ll go over the best practices which will make your feature flagging program a success. The humble Feature Flag can transform into many different things: release toggle, experiment, kill switch, permissioning and more. I’ll talk briefly about the possibilities Feature Flags open up, and then describe how to use best practices of visibility and accountability to align those different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After this talk, you’ll know what best practices make a successful feature flagging program, and be able to implement them into your current solution to deploy faster and with less risk.

The Python Packaging Authority has been working hard to solve this problem with a new distribution format for compiled Python code, called “wheels.”

In this talk, we’ll descend into the practice of PEPs 513 and 571: arcane scrolls that can equip Python developers with spells to pre-compile applications and libraries in a way that allows most Linux end users to run them directly. I’ll show you how to hex compiled artifacts and source code into the wheel format, harness application binary interfaces (ABIs) to use external libraries, brave the eldritch horrors of the dynamic linker, and bind these all together in the manylinux environment.

Serverless tends to get expensive when databases are involved.... but if your data is static or changes infrequently, you can use serverless tools to provide powerful interactive APIs extremely cheaply.

[Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python tool that provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a Docker container and instantly deploying that container to a number of different serverless hosting platforms.

This makes it a powerful tool for sharing interesting data online, in a way that allows users to both explore that data themselves and build their own interpretations of the data using the Datasette JSON API.

In this session I&#39;ll show you how to use Datasette to publish data, and illustrate examples of the exciting things people have already built using the tool - including a number of real-world data journalism projects.

I&#39;ll also teach people how to use some of the other tools in the Datasette ecosystem:

* [Datasette Publish](https://publish.datasettes.com/), which allows CSV data to be published using Datasette to a serverless hosting account owned by the user, without any engineering experience required.
* [csvs-to-sqlite](https://pypi.org/project/csvs-to-sqlite/), a tool for efficiently converting large numbers of CSV files into a Datasette-compatible SQLite database.
* [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/), a library that lets users create complex databases from custom data feeds in just a few lines of Python code (ideal for working with Jupyter notebooks).

I&#39;ll discuss the philosophy and design behind Datasette, including how immutable SQLite databases make for an impressively scalable solution for inexpensively serving complex data on the internet. Finally, I&#39;ll be exploring how Datasette takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio and the new ASGI specification.">Instant serverless APIs, powered by SQLite</a>

That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory magically. The fact that this happens automatically can erroneously lead us to believe that it is not required to worry about what happens behind the scenes.

Nothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care.

Although these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case. This topic is not a purely theoretical matter nor is it difficult to find its practical applications. In this talk, we will explain why it is something that should matter to us, and we will talk about how to apply the knowledge we have gained to specific problems.">Time to take out the rubbish: garbage collector</a>

In this talk, we&#39;ll use an example project to demonstrate the most common performance pitfalls encountered when using the Django admin, and fix them - live!

After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years, a closed-loop system has been developed to algorithmically regulate people&#39;s blood sugars. After reverse engineering bluetooth sensors and 915 MHz insulin pumps, the system became possible. As a diabetic, I also built this system and saw my sugar values stabilize much more than I could ever achieve doing it manually myself. Now I&#39;m working on contributing back to the projects as well.

I want to talk about this system, from a technical side as well as a personal side. I&#39;ll talk about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. I also want to show how it&#39;s helped me, and what this means for my health now and in the future.

Since then, variable annotations (plus, more recently, protocols) improved its capabilities even further. Over the last two years, tools, such as mypy, could build on top of it. Slowly, these annotations have emerged from a proof of concept state (e.g., mypy API planning) to becoming a stable feature.

In this presentation, I&#39;ll tell my story of using type hints for both adding type hinting and checking type correctness for a library supporting both Python 2 and 3 and reusing this information to insert type data into the generated Sphinx documentation automatically.">Type hinting (and mypy)</a>

long various parts of your program are executed. Profiling is useful
to understand what makes your program slow and how you can improve
it. After a quick review of deterministic profiling tools and
techniques, I will describe how you can do statistical profiling with
existing packages or write your own from scratch.

Statistical profiling involves occasionally sampling what your program
is doing instead of watching each line or function. A key feature of
statistical profiling is that by using a moderate sampling frequency,
you can profile your production code with almost no overhead. This lets
you find the actual bottlenecks in real use cases.

The core technical focus of the talk is python&#39;s sys module and how it
lets you easily examine a running program. I also describe some tricks
to be aware of related to threading, context switches, locks, and so on.
At the conclusion of the talk, you will hopefully understand how to use
an existing statistical profiler or write a customized version yourself.

Translation of terms is only one step in the whole Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) process. It also entails number, date and time formatting, currency conversion, sorting, legal requirements, among other issues.

We will also see how one can enable local support for their website in Django. Finally, this presentation will discuss how we can manage Internationalization and Localization for a bigger product running in different platforms (front and back end) and how to incorporate i18n and l10n into our current development and deploy processes.

But inheritance comes with some unhappy strings attached. Inheritance, by its very nature, tends to bind a subclass to its superclass. This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance.

In this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition. My intention is not to demonize inheritance, but instead present how to use it wisely in order to improve the design of our object-oriented software so that it’s more flexible and easier to maintain.">The Perils of Inheritance: Why We Should Prefer Composition</a>

As machine learning becomes more prevalent in socially impactful domains like policing, lending, and education these questions take on a new urgency.

In this talk I’ll introduce several common metrics which measure the fairness of model predictions. Next I’ll relate these metrics to different notions of fairness and show how the context in which a model or product is used determines which metrics (if any) are applicable. To illustrate this context-dependence I&#39;ll describe a case study of anonymized real-world data. Next, I&#39;ll highlight some open source tools in the Python ecosystem which address model fairness.

CUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. 

There are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. 

For some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.

If you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.

Finally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.

This talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach. ">CUDA in your Python: Effective Parallel Programming on the GPU</a>

And depending on the users, it can be installed on thousands on computers or on a selected few systems. https://pypi.org is our goto place for finding any dependencies and also in most of the time we install binary wheels directly
from there, thus saving a lot time.

But, Python is also being used in many environments where security is the utter most important, and validating the dependencies of project is also very critical along with the actual project source code.  Many of noticed the recent incident where people were being able to [steal bticoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).This talk will take [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how we tried to tackle the similar problem. SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems.

There are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian&#39;s deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.

We use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.
This talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels&#39; sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process.  The final output is reproducible Debian packages.">Building reproducible Python applications for secured environments</a>

We’ll also explore some language myths and best practices.">Python Security Tools</a>

In December, Python core developers voted on a new governance structure to guide Python going forward.  This talk explores what’s changing and how it may impact the Python community.

Based on analysis of the relevant PEPs and other documentation, and strengthened via a series of interviews with core developers and other community leaders, we’ll cover Python governance past, present and future.  Particular care will be taken to explain why the core developers chose the governance model they did, what the new system entails, and how community members can participate in it.">A New Era in Python Governance</a>

If you want to solve problems quickly—whether it&#39;s inconsistent results, crashes, or slowness—you need to understand what was going on in your process as it was running: you need logging.

In this talk you&#39;ll learn how to use the Eliot logging library to create causal traces of your computation, including intermediate inputs and outputs. You&#39;ll then see how these traces can help you:

* Ensure the computation ran as expected.
* Debug problems that may have occurred far along within your computation.
* Identify and localize performance problems: which parts of your computation were slow, and what arguments were involved.">Logging for Scientific Computing: Reproducibility, Debugging, Optimization </a>

While it encompasses traditional devops areas such as monitoring, metrics, and infrastructure management, it’s much deeper and empowers developers at all levels of the stack. **Observability is about achieving a deep understanding of your software**. This not only helps you localize and debug production issues but removes uncertainty and speculation, **empowering developers** to know their tools and improving engineering excellence. Observability helps developers “understand the narrative” of what’s going on in their software.

This talk is about how we’ve driven adoption of a culture of observability within our engineering culture. We&#39;ll define and motivate for our focus on observability; discuss the tangible tools we’ve built and best practices we’ve adopted to ingrain observability into our engineering culture; and provide some specific, real-world results we’ve achieved as part of this effort. We&#39;ll will focus particularly on the tooling we’ve adopted around Django and Celery  and some interesting experiences we had extending their internals.">Building a Culture of Observability</a>

As a new developer to a team it can be difficult to understand existing strategies and patterns that are sometimes flat out bad (and often openly acknowledged as such). Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it? Come learn strategies for refactoring with minimal impact, methods for working with bad code you can’t change, and strategies for knowing the difference between what is fixable and what is better left alone.

Despite community perception, more than half of Python usage is on Windows, including web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible.

This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform libraries. From simple things like using `pathlib` rather than `bytes`, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work.">Python on Windows is Okay, Actually</a>

The answer is to have a computer *write your tests for you!*  You declare what kind of input should work - from &#39;an integer&#39; to &#39;matching this regex&#39; to &#39;this Django model&#39; and write a test which should always pass... then Hypothesis searches for the smallest inputs that cause an error.

If you’ve ever written tests that didn&#39;t find all your bugs, this talk is for you.  We&#39;ll cover the theory of property-based testing, a worked example, and then jump into a whirlwind tour of the library: how to use, define, compose, and infer strategies for input; properties and testing tactics for your code; and how to debug your tests if everything seems to go wrong.

By the end of this talk, you&#39;ll be ready to find real bugs with Hypothesis in anything from web apps to big data pipelines to CPython itself.  Be the change you want to see in your codebase - or contribute to Hypothesis itself and help drag the world kicking and screaming into a new and terrifying age of high quality software!">Escape from auto-manual testing with Hypothesis!</a>

BeeWare is a set of software libraries for cross-platform native app development from a single Python codebase and tools to simplify app deployment. The project aims to build, deploy, and run apps for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iPhone, and the web. It is native because it is actually using your platform&#39;s native GUI widgets, not a theme, icon pack, or webpage wrapper.
