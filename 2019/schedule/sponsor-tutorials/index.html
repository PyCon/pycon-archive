Even if you are a seasoned Python wizard it takes some effort to get your bearings when working with geographical data.  In this workshop, we&#39;ll start with some beginner projects to build geospatial applications.

- How to identify the location of an image file with PIL
- How to find places on a map with NLTK
- How to read/write geospatial file types with tools like geopandas
- How to visualize point clouds from GPS traces or LiDAR data with PPTK
- How to store and query vector tiles with XYZ

By the end of our time together you will have gone from Hello World to having a roadmap for where to learn more about geospatial tools and techniques.

In this talk, you will learn how we created proxy labels for recurrent transactions using python and Apache Spark. Some examples of recurring transactions are Netflix and Spotify subscriptions. The best part about the approach we used is that it did not require paying humans to manually create labels, saving both time and money while increasing accuracy since it bypasses human error.

Because of the robustness of the proxy labels created, we were able to improve upon a previously rule-based process for determining recurring transactions. This ensures that customers do not experience interruption when their card is replaced and they are notified when subscription costs increase significantly, among many other benefits.

### Abstract

#### Audience

The target audience is machine learning engineers, data scientists, and finance/banking folks. However, anyone with an interest in machine learning or banking will benefit from the talk.

#### Objectives

The audience will come away with an understanding of an approach to create labels for unlabeled data and get exposure to a situation in which python and Apache Spark provide business value.

#### Notes

The project has evolved greatly since this article was written, but still provides useful context for understanding value proposition of predicting recurring transactions.

We are constantly making decisions on how to make software processes faster, more efficient, or cheaper to operate. There is a lot of misguided wisdom, folklore, and superstition around software performance that can be as much help as hindrance. In our tutorial, we&#39;ll present some fundamental rules of software performance as a set of physical, intuitive laws, with illustrative examples. Our goal is for every audience member to leave with enough of a grounding in these underlying laws to make rational performance decisions when selecting their programming tools, algorithms, and hardware.

Audience:
This tutorial is intended for audiences without a computer science background, or those with a computer science background who are interested in discussing and explaining performance concepts to those without it. Some programming experience in Python will be helpful, as will access to the tutorial notebooks and the ability to run them live. Mathematics will be discussed, but will not be required beyond a high school level to understand and engage.

Continuing with tradition, our sponsor workshop session features three awesome half-hour Python tech talks at they relate to Google. Hear about Python tools we’ve built in-house, using Python with Google developer tools to build your web &amp; mobile applications with, or best practices on how we use Python internally at Google. You’re invited to stop by and hear from a cadre of world-class Google engineers from around the world! :-) 

1- What’s New with TensorFlow 2.0

Speaker: Brad Miro, Google, New York

Abstract

Learn about the updates being made to TensorFlow in its 2.0 version. We’ll give an overview of what’s available in the new version as well as do a deep dive into an example using its central high-level API, Keras. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of how you can get started building machine learning models in Python with TensorFlow 2.0 as well as the other exciting available features!

He is currently a Developer Programs Engineer at Google where he specializes in machine learning and big data solutions. Outside of work, Brad can be found singing, skiing, playing board games and locating the best restaurants in NYC.

2 - Extreme Python Operator Overloading using AST Manipulation

Speaker: Brian Lee, Google, Cambridge

Abstract

Python&#39;s `__add__, __iter__, __getitem__, __enter__`, and other magic dunder methods grant extraordinary flexibility in constructing new libraries and domain-specific languages on top of Python. It&#39;s very easy to create new context managers, overload object slicing, implement custom initializers/destructors, and more. With this power, library authors have wrapped C libraries like libxml2 (lxml) or blas/lapack (NumPy) with more Pythonic APIs.

However, there are core Python features and syntax that can&#39;t be overridden, like for/while loops, conditionals, and built-ins like zip and enumerate. It&#39;s not even obvious how these should be defined, since they can&#39;t be defined on a per-class basis like every other dunder method.

In this talk, we&#39;ll discuss how to use AST manipulation to override the behavior of Python control flow and other builtins, and why one might want to do such a thing. These AST manipulation utilities are used by TensorFlow&#39;s AutoGraph functionality, which we&#39;ll briefly discuss.

Brian is a Pythonista of 8 years and works at Google on TensorFlow AutoGraph and Minigo, among other things.

3 - Ask a Google Engineer Anything

Moderator: Wesley Chun, Google, Sunnyvale

Abstract

This is an AMA session, giving all of you a chance to ask a Google engineer burning questions on your minds. That doesn’t mean we’ll be able to answer, however we’ll do our best! First popularized at OSCON back in 2010 then debuting at PyCon in 2013, these sessions are useful in helping developers become familiar with Alphabet, Googlers, their roles, products, and technologies, as well as be able answer technical questions that have them curious. It&#39;s been over 6 years since that first one at PyCon so it&#39;s about that time again. For half-hour, we’ll corral as many Googlers as we can get at PyCon to participate in this informative yet entertaining Q&amp;A session.
