DevOps Engineer, Azure (Remote) https://platform.sh/company/careers/job/?gh_jid=4248070002 
This role is open to remote full time people.

Platform.sh is a groundbreaking hosting and development tool for web applications. We’re a European VC-Backed startup with a host of blue-chip Enterprise clients and a string of awards and grants (including €2m from the EU Horizon 2020 program).

To reinforce our technical prowess, we are looking to grow our operations team. If you’re looking for an exciting, high-growth opportunity with an award-winning, cutting-edge company, this could be just the job for you

For its PaaS solution https://platform.sh is looking for an Operations and Service Reliability Engineer with a taste for Python and Go, great Linux system understanding, and a real hunger for the challenges of building robust, distributed systems.

Platform.sh is a PaaS shrouded in a lot of black magic (we can consistently clone a whole running cluster, with its state, databases, indexes in a matter of seconds). We want to get this down to the hundreds of milliseconds domain. Interested? There is more...

We can consistently generate from the same manifest a Docker container, an LXC one, or VM disk images (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), we want more targets.

We probably have the highest industry container density. We need to get it higher.

We support any Python, Ruby, NodeJS or PHP, Java and .NET.

Directly reporting to our Director of Infrastructure and in close interaction with our Engineering and Customer Support teams, you will be responsible for:

cloud operations: configure clusters, deploy stuff, follow-up on alerts, help customer support debug issues, all in Microsoft Azure
automating all of the above so they can instead drink margaritas (or non-alcoholic beverages, of course)
creating systems, tools &amp;amp; processes that will enhance our support and operations efficiency
improving service quality, discipline and reliability throughout lifecycle
monitoring operating objectives, streamline and automate intervention
continuous learning from Operations experience, modeled as software
The ideal candidate:

has proven successful experience in an operations role
has demonstrated the ability to successfully manage cloud-based infrastructure for a fast growing organization
has experience with containerization technologies
has had exposure to cloud services (Azure)
understands how an OS works, knows networking, how git works, and the constraints of a distributed system
Puppet experience
is proficient in Python (Golang a plus)
Nice to have :

knowledge of Magento Ecommerce, Symfony, Drupal, eZ Platform, or Typo3
relational database skills
Note: We don&#39;t like stress, so we build everything to be robust and resilient, but stuff does break. This is a role with on-call duties. If page-duty fills you with dread... well, this might not be a fit.

- Be a thought leader in the developer community who can give engaging presentations to and write useful content for our target audience, about both Kite and programming best practices
- An outward facing advocate for Kite&#39;s next-generation developer tool
- Be the voice of the developer during product discussions and evaluating priorities of bugs and feature requests
- An entrepreneurial leader with the ability to brainstorm and prioritize projects with only high-level direction
- A teacher and mentor to others in the community through engaging talks at Python events
- Hustling skills - get out there, meet people and make connections in unexpected places 

Who You Are
- Software engineering background with at least a Computer Science degree or 2+ years working as an engineer (or equivalent)
- Passion for the Python programming language and excited to work within the Python community
- A high curiosity of how software works and an eagerness to learn new tricks
