## TL;DR
We are running mentored sprints for diverse community members  ✨

**When:** **4th of May 2019** during the main PyCon session fom **2:30pm to 6:30pm** but you can participate for 2 or 4 hours. **Room 25C**.

✨ **Apply to be a mentor** on the day or feature your open source project:  [https://goo.gl/forms/YCZP5auVi5ZFtMjg1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3D0BvnhgLRbtK2LOC-aAAkvZt484RCpwY0lpFdsFljEy9ig/viewform?usp=sf_link) 

✨ **Apply to participate as a contributor** (sprint on the day): [https://goo.gl/forms/d3Blf8wgxWVoSIgO2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmUDvXXHRgkBpYcHpy6O3txHEeLihz6g7hlXHThlLJMJ2zig/viewform?usp=sf_link)

If you are not a member of an underrepresented group of the community and want to take on the sprint we encourage you to bring someone from an underrepresented group with you.

## About the sprints 

Open source projects such as Python and its multiple stacks (web, scientific, etc.) are nothing but a collaborative effort from many community members. It is the constant involvement of the numerous maintainers, contributors, and users that make open source software sustainable and keeps the community as a whole going.

Walking the path from user to collaborator, and thus contributing to an open source project, can sometimes be intimidating especially for newcomers. From a technical perspective, interacting with web-based hosting services (such as GitHub, GitLab, etc.), branching and opening pull requests can be overwhelming if these are not everyday actions of your workflow. The correctness of the code and potential bugs are other common obstacles and fears any newcomer might face. Not to mention the time and frustration accumulated over the task of finding a ‘beginner-friendly’ issue to work on.

We also recognize that some groups are traditionally underrepresented in the open source community and we would like to support them in their open source path.
For these reasons, we are running the first ever PyCon mentored sprints for individuals from underrepresented groups willing to start contributing to Python projects. This event will provide a supportive, friendly, and safe environment for all the attendees and partner open source projects.

To achieve this goal, we are seeking to work with a number of Python projects and their maintainers interested in providing mentorship
to these individuals. In return, we will provide guidance and advise on how to prepare the projects for the day and to better serve a diverse range of contributors.


## Why do we need a mentored sprint when we already run sprints within PyCon?

The PyCon sprints certainly offer a great opportunity to get contributors and developers together and to squash a number of bugs in a relatively short period of time. However, with this happening at the end of the event many people, particularly less experienced developers, are not able to stay around for this additional time, or cannot easily justify attending an event for an extra day or two. In addition, a good amount of the people that attend the sprints are often comfortable doing so and in many cases have made multiple contributions to open source before or are, in fact, developers or maintainers of open source projects.

This mentored sprint focuses on providing less experienced developers a supportive environment in which they can learn, collaborate, expand their network, and celebrate their victories at the end of it.

Furthermore, it serves as a great opportunity for a number of open source projects to get some practical advise around inclusion and how to serve a global and diverse pool of contributors. And perhaps establish longer-term mentor-mentee or contributor relationships.


## What projects will you be sprinting on?

PyCon US is the biggest Python conference organized every year, thousands of developers, teachers, maintainers, and aficionados attend the event every year. As such it provides a unique opportunity to bring together creators, 
maintainers, and users for a few days.

By running similar events in smaller conferences we have learned that the attendees (and projects) get much more out of it by having maintainers, organizers, and attendees working together. This way the maintainers of a certain package can provide directed, effective and in-person mentoring to a group of individuals, and the attendees feel more confident and usually leave with a higher sense of accomplishment.
