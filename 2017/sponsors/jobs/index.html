- Design, develop, and deliver amazing software solutions
- Encourage and promote innovation, development best practices, and solid lifecycle processes
- Collaborate with your team on work definition, estimation, and prioritization - you’ll be part of a small team that enjoys a lot of autonomy
- Participate in tooling, library, and framework research and discussion
- Learn and grow as a professional software engineer, and help other engineers grow through mentoring and pair programming

- Competitive pay, benefits, and equity.
- 2 (yes, two) work-from-home days per week.

                    <div class="job-listing">Bugsnag helps teams build better software by providing automatic error monitoring for web, mobile, desktop, and server apps. Half of a typical software engineer&#39;s time is spent finding and fixing bugs; we aim to bring that number as close to zero as possible so developers can ship better software and spend more time on feature development. To do this, we give our users instantly visibility into where their code is not executing as expecting. We measure the user impact of these errors and collect all related error and diagnostic data to give our users the information they need to understand which application errors really matter and need fixing.

We have 3,500 customers in the developer space including companies such as AirBnB, Pandora, Lyft, Yelp and Docker.

People use our service to gain access to some of the best physicians and licensed therapists in the country, all whenever and wherever is most convenient.

Through live video visits, our hand-picked, US-trained doctors take patient history, perform an exam, and recommend a treatment plan. Prescriptions, if needed, go directly to the pharmacy of choice. While insurance isn’t required, tens of millions of Americans enjoy covered medical and mental health visits through employer and health plan partnerships. To learn more about the hundreds of medical issues we treat, visit us at DoctorOnDemand.com.
 

About Engineering

Our platform offers a dramatically improved provider technology experience as compared to brick-and-mortar medical offices. Our technology is one of the main reasons we have a very high net promoter score with our providers (physicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists) who say they would recommend a colleague to work for Doctor on Demand. 

Our patients rate our app as an average of 4.7 out of 5 after 14,000 reviews. Our initial product offering was built for the purpose of video visits and technology is at the core of the company mission and purpose. 

Both our providers and our patients have a strong voice when it comes to product development. We value our customer feedback and integrate it into our development methods and decisions each day. </div>
