                        <p><p>Nooro is a small Canadian software team that has evolved with our clients&#39; ever-changing needs and following our interests since 1995.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re attending PyCon, we have nothing to sell you -- we&#39;re just here to learn and grateful for the chance to connect with our tribe once a year.</p>

<p>We couldn&#39;t do what we do without Python and eleventy-nine great Open Source projects that others (maybe you?) have built with Python. So we thought we&#39;d try to sponsor PyCon this year as a small way of giving back.</p>

<p>Looking forward to meeting you there!</p></p>

This allows FLOSS developers to focus on what they do best — writing and improving FLOSS for the general public — while Conservancy takes care of the projects&#39; needs that do not relate directly to software development and documentation.  Many Python-related projects are already members of Conservancy, and Conservancy runs an bi-annual internship program called Outreachy available to underrepresented groups in FLOSS.</p></p>

Its SQL implementation strongly                               <br />conforms to the ANSI-SQL:2008 standard. It also has a host of extensions                       <br />and advanced features. Best of all, PostgreSQL&#39;s source code is                                <br />available under a liberal open source license: the PostgreSQL License.</p></p>

                        <p><p>The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, and reproducible scientific research. We accomplish this through educational programs and events as well as fiscal sponsorship of open source data science projects. We aim to increase collaboration and communication within the scientific computing community. NumFOCUS has long been a community leader for scientific Python. The original cohort of NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored projects—NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython, and AstroPy—are all Python-based tools. Currently 13 of our 19 fiscally sponsored projects are based on Python.
