         >Today we use cryptography in almost everywhere. From surfing the web over https, to working remotely over ssh. Although most developers don&#39;t need to implement cryptography primitives, the knowledge and understanding of these building block allows them to better deploy them in their application. In modern crypto we have all the building block to develop secure application. However, we see instances of insecure code everywhere. Most of these vulnerabilities are not because of theoretic shortcomings, but due to bad implementation or a flawed protocol design. Cryptography is a delicate art where nuances matter, and failure to comprehend the subtleties of these building blocks leads to critical vulnerabilities. To add insult to injury most of the resources available are either outdated or wrong, and inarguably, using bad crypto more dangerous than not using it.

In this tutorial we look at the basic building blocks of modern cryptography. We will cover the encryption techniques, hashing mechanisms, and key devastation algorithms. Furthermore we review two of the most widely used protocol suites, SSL and PGP. We conclude by implementing a simplified version of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), that is used for encryption of texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions.</div>

Bring your laptop and we will program a predictive text engine from scratch together. Follow along as we start with IDLE (or your favorite editor) and a blank file, and end with a tested idiomatic Python module. It will learn from any text we pass into it, and predict characters or words for us. Just like your phone!</div>

Moreover, your team is writing code that is getting reused, but that code is failing in mysterious places. How do you solve this? Testing is the answer! In this tutorial, you will gain practical hands-on experience writing tests in a data science setting so that you can continually ensure the integrity of your code and data. You will learn how to use `py.test`, `coverage.py`, and `hypothesis` to write better tests for your code.</div>

Instead we can make the design of the API contract an explicit part of our development process using The OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) and open source tools.

In this workshop we will:

 - Discuss the contract-first approach
 - Build and validate a simple OpenAPI Specification
 - Generate reference documentation and show how you can incorporate it with other docs
 - Run a mock server so clients can test using the API
 - Generate stub code based on the specification
 - Implement a basic working API using Flask
 - Show how you can iteratively add features and make changes
 - Discuss generating specifications for existing APIs

Participants will leave with:

 - An understanding of how to incorporate a contract-first process into their API development workflow
 - An example specification that can be used as reference for their own API design 
 - Working code for a basic API that can be used as a basis for their own development

Participants are expected to have a basic familiarity with HTTP / RESTful APIs, understanding of simple git operations, and some development experience.</div>

 - Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports many protocols, including HTTP.
 - Klein is a Twisted-based web application framework.
 - Treq is a Requests-style HTTP client based on Twisted.

Want that app to run on your desktop as well? There&#39;s another whole stack of APIs to learn. What about a website as well? Add JavaScript, CSS, and yet more APIs to your &quot;to-learn&quot; list. Want to do all this with a single language, and a single API? Good luck with that. And if you want that language to be Python? You&#39;ve *got* to be kidding.... right? 

BeeWare is a collection of tools and libraries that allows you to build cross-platform GUI applications in pure Python, targeting desktop, mobile and web platforms. Apps created using BeeWare aren&#39;t web apps wrapped in a native shell, and they don&#39;t ignore native widget styles and UI conventions - they&#39;re 100% native. BeeWare apps are indistinguishable from applications written using the official languages and APIs for each platform. 

In this tutorial, you&#39;ll be introduced to the BeeWare suite of tools and libraries, and use those tools to develop, from scratch, a simple GUI application. You&#39;ll then deploy that application as a standalone desktop application, a mobile phone application, and a single page webapp - without making any changes to the application&#39;s codebase.</div>

         >Python developers use decorators and descriptors on a daily basis, but many don&#39;t understand them well enough to create (or debug) them. Decorators are widely deployed in popular Python Web frameworks. Descriptors are the key to the database mappers used with those frameworks, but under the covers they play an even more crucial role in Python as the device that turns plain functions into bound methods, setting the value of the `self` argument. This tutorial is a gentle introduction these important language features, using a test-driven presentation and exercises, and covering enhancements in Python 3.6 that make class metaprogramming easier to get right.

Decorators without closures are presented first, highlighting the difference between _run time_ and _import time_ that is crucial when meta-programming. We then get a firm grounding on closures and how they are implemented in Python, before moving to higher order function decorators and class decorators.

Coverage of descriptors starts with a close look at Python&#39;s `property` built-in function and dynamic attribute look up. We then implement some ORM-like field validation descriptors, encounter a usability problem, and leverage PEP 487 -- Simpler customisation of class creation -- to solve it. Alternative implementations using a class decorator and a metaclass will be contrasted to the PEP 487 solution.

         >With the recent advancements in machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, and the increasing ease of implementing them in Python, it is tempting to ignore the power and necessity of exploratory data analysis (EDA), the crucial step before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling. Simply applying machine learning algorithms without a proper orientation of the dataset can lead to wasted time and spurious conclusions. EDA allows practitioners to gain intuition for the pattern of the data, identify anomalies, narrow down a set of alternative modeling approaches, devise strategies to handle missing data, and ensure correct interpretation of the results. Further, EDA can rapidly generate insights and answer many questions without requiring complex modeling.

Python is a fantastic language not only for machine learning, but also EDA. In this tutorial, we will walk through two hands-on examples of how to perform EDA using Python and discuss various EDA techniques for cross-section data, time-series data, and panel data. One example will demonstrate how to use EDA to answer questions, test business assumptions, and generate hypotheses for further analysis. The other example will focus on performing EDA to prepare for modeling.  Between these two examples, we will cover: 

* Data profiling and quality assessment
* Basic describing of the data 
* Visualizing the data including interactive visualizations 
* Identifying patterns in the data (including patterns of correlated missing data)
* Dealing with many attributes (columns) 
* Dealing with large datasets using sampling techniques
* Informing the engineering of features for future modeling 
* Identifying challenges of using the data (e.g. skewness, outliers) 
* Developing an intuition for interpreting the results of future modeling 

The intended audience for this tutorial are aspiring and practicing data scientists and analysts, or anyone who wants to be able to get insights out of data. Students must have at least an intermediate-level knowledge of Python and some familiarity with analyzing data would be beneficial. Installation of Jupyter Notebook will be required (and potentially, we will also demonstrate analysis in JupyterLab, if its development in the next few months allows). Instructions will be sent on what packages to install beforehand.

And while the web offers a seemingly boundless source for custom data sets, the collection of that data can present a whole host of obstacles. From ever-changing APIs to rate-limiting woes, from nightmarishly nested XML to convoluted DOM trees, working with APIs and web scraping are challenging but critically useful skills for application developers and data scientists alike. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce RESTful APIs, RSS feeds, and web scraping in order to see how different ingestion techniques impact application development. We’ll explore how and when to use Python libraries such as `feedparser`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, and `urllib`. And finally we will present common data collection problems and how to overcome them. 


We’ll take a hands-on, directed exercise approach combined with short presentations to engage a range of different APIs (with and without authentication), explore examples of how and why you might web scrape, and learn the ethical and legal considerations for both. To prepare attendees to create their own data ingestion scripts, the tutorial will walk through a set of examples for robust and responsible data collection and ingestion. This tutorial will conclude with a case study of [Baleen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/baleen/0.3.3), an automated RSS ingestion service designed to construct a production-grade text corpus for NLP research and machine learning applications. Exercises will be presented both as Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

         >Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory.
Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques
as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation
for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.
Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.

Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages
for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce
program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a
price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more
complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find
out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start?
This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how
to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.
You will experience that one&#39;s gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.

The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is
important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.

Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.

## Software Requirements

You will need Python 2.7 or 3.5 installed on your laptop. Python 2.6 or 3.3/3.4
should also work. Python 3.x is strongly preferred.


### Jupyter Notebook

I will use a Jupyter Notebook for the tutorial because it makes a very good
teaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,
REPL. If you also like to use a Jupyter Notebook, I recommend `conda` for
easy installation. Similarly to `virtualenv`, `conda` allows creating isolated
environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install `Jupyter` via `conda`:

1. Use [Minconda][10]. This is a  small install and (after you installed it)
   you can use the command  `conda` to create an environment:
  `conda create -n pycon2016 python=3.5`
   Now you can change into this environment:
   `source activate pycon2016`. The prompt should change to `(pycon2017)`.
   Now you can install IPython: `conda install Jupyter`.

2. Install [Anaconda][20] and you are ready to go if you don&#39;t mind installing
   lots of packages from the scientific field.

### Working with ``conda`` environments

After creating a new environment, the system might still work with some
stale settings. Even when the command ``which`` tells you that you are using an
executable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.
If you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,
use ``hash -r`` and try again.

[10]: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
[20]: http://continuum.io/downloads


### Tools

You can install these with ``pip`` (in the active ``conda`` environment):

* [SnakeViz][3]
* [line_profiler][4]
* [Pympler][6]
* [memory_profiler][7]
* [pyprof2calltree][9]



#### Linux

Using the package manager of your OS should be the best option.

         >The CPython interpreter allows us implement modules in C for performance
critical code or to interface with external libraries while presenting users
with a high level Python API. This tutorial will teach you how to leverage to
power of C in your Python projects.

We will start by explaining the C representation of Python objects and how to
manipulate them from within C. We will then move on to implementing functions in
C for use in Python. We will discuss reference counting and correct exception
handling. We will also talk about how to package and build your new extension
module so that it may be shared on PyPI. (We will only be covering building
extension modules on GNU/Linux and OSX, not Windows).

After the break, we will show how to implement a new type in C. This will cover
how to hook into various protocols and properly support cyclic garbage
collection. We will also discuss techniques for debugging C extension modules
with gdb using the CPython gdb extension.

Unlike many introductory statistics courses, we will not be applying &quot;cookbook&quot; methods that are easy to teach, but often inapplicable; instead, we will learn some foundational statistical methods that can be applied generally to a wide variety of problems: maximum likelihood, bootstrapping, linear regression, and other modern techniques. The tutorial will start with a short introduction on data manipulation and cleaning using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), before proceeding on to simple concepts like fitting data to statistical distributions, and how to use Monte Carlo simulation for data analysis. Slightly more advanced topics include bootstrapping (for estimating uncertainty around estimates) and flexible linear regression methods using Bayesian methods. By using and modifying hand-coded implementations of these techniques, students will gain an understanding of how each method works. Students will come away with knowledge of how to deal with very practical statistical problems, such as how to deal with missing data, how to check a statistical model for appropriateness, and how to properly express the uncertainty in the quantities estimated by statistical methods. </div>

These techniques are tremendously useful, because they help us to understand, to explain, and to predict data through building a model that accounts for the data and is capable of synthesizing it. This is called the generative approach to statistical pattern recognition.

Estimating the parameters of Bayesian models has always been hard, impossibly hard actually in many cases for anyone but experts. However, recent advances in probabilistic programming have endowed us with tools to estimate models with a lot of parameters and for a lot of data. In this tutorial, we will discuss two of these tools, PyMC3 and Edward. These are black box tools, swiss army knifes for Bayesian modeling that do not require knowledge in calculus or numerical integration. This puts the power of Bayesian statistics into the hands of everyone, not only experts of the field. And, it&#39;s great that these are implemented in Python with its rich, beginner-friendly ecosystem. It means we can immediately start playing with it...

We have planned three awesome parts, spread over three awesome hours:

* First hour: Introduction to Bayesian machine learning.

* Second hour: Baby steps in PyMC3 and Edward.

* Third hour: Solve a real-world problem with PyMC3 or Edward (model, fit, criticize).

         ># Description

IPython and Jupyter provide tools for interactive computing that are widely
used in scientific computing, education, and data science, but can benefit any
Python developer.

You will learn how to use IPython in different ways, as:

- an interactive shell,
- a graphical console,
- a network-aware VM (Virtual machine) in GUIs,
- a web-based notebook combining code, graphics and rich HTML.

We will demonstrate how to deploy a custom environment
with Docker that not only contains multiple Python kernels but also a couple
of other languages.

# Objectives

At the end of this tutorial, attendees will have an understanding of the
overall design of Jupyter (and IPython) as a suite of applications they can use
and combine in multiple ways in the course of their development work with
Python and other programming languages. They will learn:

* Tricks from the IPython machinery that are useful in everyday development,

* What high-level applications in Jupyter, the web-based notebooks, can do and
  how these applications can be used.

* How to use IPython and Jupyter together so that they can be best used for the
  problem at hand.

# Detailed Abstract

IPython started in 2001 simply as a better interactive Python shell. Over the
last decade it has grown into a powerful set of interlocking tools that
maximize developer productivity in Python while working interactively.

Today, Jupyter consists of an IPython kernel that executes user code, provides
many features for introspection and namespace manipulation, and tools to
control this kernel either in-process or out-of-process thanks to a well
specified communications protocol implemented over ZeroMQ. This architecture
allows the core features to be accessed via a variety of clients, each
providing unique functionality tuned to a specific use case:

* An interactive, terminal-based shell with capabilities beyond the default
  Python interactive interpreter (this is the classic application opened by the
  `ipython` command that many users have worked with)

* A [web-based notebook](http://jupyter.org/) that can execute
  code and also contain rich text and figures, mathematical equations and
  arbitrary HTML. This notebook presents a document-like view with cells where
  code is executed but that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with
  explanatory text and figures, etc. The notebook provides an interactive
  experience that combines live code and results with literate documentation
  and the rich media that modern browsers can display:

    ![Notebook screenshot](http://jupyter.org/assets/jupyterpreview.png)

  The notebooks also allow for code in multiple languages allowing to mix Python
  with Cython, C, R and other programming languages to access features hard to obain from
  Python.

These tools also increasingly work with languages other than Python, and we
renamed the language independent frontend components to *Jupyter* in order to
make this clearer. The Python kernel we provide and the original terminal-based
shell will continue to be called *IPython*.

In this hands-on, in-depth tutorial, we will briefly describe IPython&#39;s
architecture and will then show how to use the above tools for a highly
productive workflow in Python.

The materials for this tutorial are
[available on a github repository](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth).

If you&#39;re building a web app, you probably reach for your favorite framework -- Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc. But we rarely stop to think about what these tools are doing under the hood. In this hands-on tutorial, you&#39;ll gain a deeper understanding of what frameworks are and how they work by implementing your own framework from scratch. We&#39;ll build a complete (if minimal) web framework that handles the WSGI request/response cycle, routing, controllers, templating, and a data layer. Along the way you&#39;ll gain a deeper understanding of the decisions web frameworks make, their relative merits, and inner workings.</div>

         >An overview of parallel computing techniques available from Python and hands-on experience with a variety of frameworks.

This course has two primary goals:
  1. Teach students how to reason about parallel computing
  2. Provide hands-on experience with a variety of different parallel computing frameworks

Students will walk away with both a high-level understanding of parallel problems and how to select and use an appropriate parallel computing framework for their problem.  They will get hands-on experience using tools both on their personal laptop, and on a cluster environment that will be provided for them at the tutorial.

For the first half we cover programming patterns for parallelism found across many tools, notably map, futures, and big-data collections. We investigate these common APIs by diving into a sequence of examples that require increasingly complex tools.  We learn the benefits and costs of each API and the sorts of problems where each is appropriate.

For the second half, we focus on the performance aspects of frameworks and give intuition on how to pick the right tool for the job. This includes common challenges in parallel analysis, such as communication costs, debugging parallel code, as well as deployment and setup strategies.</div>

         >This tutorial is for developers who&#39;ve been using Python for a while and would consider themselves at an intermediate level, but are looking for a deeper understanding of the language.  It focuses on how Python differs from other languages in subtle but important ways that are often confusing, and it demystifies a number of language features that are sometimes misunderstood.

In many ways Python is very similar to other programming languages.  However, in a few subtle ways it is quite different, and many software developers new to Python, after their initial successes, hit a plateau and have difficulty getting past it.  Others don&#39;t hit or perceive a plateau, but still find some of Python&#39;s features a little mysterious or confusing.  This tutorial will help deconstruct some common incorrect assumptions about Python.

If in your use of Python you sometimes feel like an outsider, like you&#39;re missing the inside jokes, like you have most of the puzzle pieces but they don&#39;t quite fit together yet, or like there are parts of Python you just don&#39;t get, this may be a good tutorial for you.

After completing this tutorial you&#39;ll have a deeper understanding of many Python features.  Here are some of the topics we&#39;ll cover:

- How objects are created and names are assigned to them

- Ways to modify a namespace: assignment, import, function definition and call, and class definition and instantiation.  Much of the tutorial is structured around namespaces and how they get modified to help you understand most of the differences between variables in other languages and those in Python, including

    - why Python has neither pass-by-value nor pass-by-reference function call semantics,

    - and why parameters passed to a function can sometimes be changed by it and sometimes cannot.

- Iterables, iterators, and the iterator protocol, including how to make class instances iterable

- How to use generators to make your code easier to read and understand

- Hacking classes after their definition, and creating classes without a class statement, as an exercise to better understand how they work

- Bound versus unbound methods, how they&#39;re implemented, and interesting things you can do with bound methods

- How and why you might want to create or use a partial function

- Example use-cases of functions as first-class objects

- Unpacking and packing arguments with * and ** on function call and definition

         >*What’s the web all about anyway? How can you make your computer talk to other computers with Python?*

Modern web frameworks such as Django and Flask are immensely powerful. However, these useful tools obscure the foundations of network programming upon which they are based, which can be very helpful to understand. So instead of building useful applications with these libraries, let&#39;s experiment with sockets!

At this tutorial, a Python-flavored history of the web will be presented and attendees will write or modify a TCP chat client, a static site web server, an HTTP client, a CGI script, and a WSGI-compliant server and web application. We will learn what all those things are and how they fit together, bringing the architecture of modern web apps into better focus.

The material will be accessible to participants with no web development experience, however, they must be able to write and run Python scripts at the command-line. This tutorial might appeal to someone also attending an introductory web development tutorial, but it covers separate, complementary material. Web development experience is not required but a little exposure would be helpful; for instance, installing flask and running the minimal application on the [quickstart page](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/quickstart/). Similarly, prior exposure to HTML would be useful but is not necessary.</div>
