         >You’ve built a fine Python web application and now you’re ready to share it with the world. But what’s the best way to deploy your app in 2017?

This talk will demonstrate popular techniques for deploying Python web applications. We’ll start with a simple Flask application and expose it to the world five times over as we learn to use different tools and services available to the modern Python developer.

Specific topics covered include:

* Exposing your local dev environment with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
* Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* Going “serverless” with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* Configuring your own VM with [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
* Thinking inside the box using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

We’ll also briefly touch on the pros and cons of each technique to help you figure out which one is right for your app.

At the end of this talk you will have a basic understanding of how each of these techniques work and you’ll be ready to try them out yourself.</div>

         >smtpd.py has been in the standard library for many years.  It&#39;s been a common tool for deploying SMTP and LMTP servers that handle email-based communication in Python, providing both basic protocol implementations and a fundamental module for higher level tools, such as lazr.smtptest for testing email clients.  Based on asyncore and asynchat, smtpd.py is showing its age, and its API is unwieldy.

Fortunately, there&#39;s a new alternative available.  aiosmtpd is a modern reinvention based on asyncio, with all the improvements that come along with such a new implementation.  It provides servers for both the SMTP and LMTP protocols, as well as a higher level &quot;controller&quot; API for testing SMTP and LMTP clients.  It exposes a much better API for customization, allowing the user to associate a simple &quot;handler&quot; to process incoming messages without having to worry about the details of the protocols, and it provides some useful hooks for subclassing.

This talk will describe the purpose and history of smtpd.py and aiosmtpd, show how users can extend the servers and implement specialized handlers, and show how applications can use the testing API for ensuring that their email sending applications do the right things.  Examples will be taken from GNU Mailman 3, which uses aiosmtpd extensively.</div>

         >Music is mainly an artistic act of inspired creation and is unlike some of the traditional math problems.  Music cannot be solved by a simple set of formulae. The most interesting and challenging part is producing unique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has to sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective and varies from culture to culture.

Artificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has a wide range of applications, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing, Time series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? Could we use deep learning to create music? 

This talk is about how deep learning models were used to produce music - catering particularly to Bollywood.

This talk would show how an exquisite piece of art i.e. music can be generated using deep learning model which helps in automated feature extraction. In order to automate the music generation, the model must be able to remember the learned features over the longer period of time, this is achieved by a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network. 

Implementation of such complex model can be made much easier using inbuilt Python libraries such as Keras with Theano as backend. It allows for easy and fast prototyping. Packages like numpy and scipy are being used for easier mathematical computation of input vectors and for reading/writing the WAV files respectively. The neural network architecture makes use of numerous amount of music samples to train the model. After an adequate number of iterations and training time, this model generates music that is unique and original. 

In this talk, steps involved in preprocessing of data, training the model, testing the model and generating the music from the trained model will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and tradeoffs made for algorithmic music generation.

         >Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning focused on building agents: software that can robustly achieve a desired objective under varying states of the world. This introduction will provide you with an overview of RL and tools to build your own agents.  In this talk, we will provide an overview of terminology in reinforcement learning and a Jupyter Notebook outlining basic algorithms to learn &#39;policies&#39;, strategies for an agent, and visualize them with numpy, pandas, and seaborn.  Newer developments in reinforcement learning apply deep learning to improve performance.  We will further discuss deep reinforcement learning and how to use deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow or Theano, with the latest RL libraries: [OpenAI Gym][1], [OpenAI Universe](https://universe.openai.com), and [DeepMind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab).

    <div class="presentation-description"
         >As the applications we build are increasingly driven by text, doing data ingestion, management, loading, and preprocessing in a robust, organized, parallel, and memory-safe way can get tricky. This talk walks through the highs (a custom billion-word corpus!), the lows (segfaults, 400 errors, pesky mp3s), and the new Python libraries we built to ingest and preprocess text for machine learning.

While applications like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa may still seem like novelties, language-aware applications are rapidly becoming the new norm. Under the hood, these applications take in text data as input, parse it into composite parts, compute upon those composites, and then recombine them to deliver a meaningful and tailored end result. The best applications use language models trained on _domain-specific corpora_ (collections of related documents containing natural language) that reduce ambiguity and prediction space to make results more intelligible. Here&#39;s the catch: these corpora are huge, generally consisting of at least hundreds of gigabytes of data inside of thousands of documents, and often more!

In this talk, we&#39;ll see how working with text data is substantially different from working with numeric data, and show that ingesting a raw text corpus in a form that will support the construction of a data product is no trivial task. For instance, when dealing with a text corpus, you have to consider not only how the data comes in (e.g. respecting rate limits, terms of use, etc.), but also where to store the data and how to keep it organized. Because the data comes from the web, it&#39;s often unpredictable, containing not only text but audio files, ads, videos, and other kinds of web detritus. Since the datasets are large, you need to anticipate potential performance problems and ensure memory safety through streaming data loading and multiprocessing. Finally, in anticipation of the machine learning components, you have to establish a standardized method of transforming your raw ingested text into a corpus that&#39;s ready for computation and modeling.

In this talk, we&#39;ll explore many of the challenges we experienced along the way and introduce two Python packages that make this work a bit easier: [Baleen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/baleen/0.3.3) and [Minke](https://github.com/bbengfort/minke). Baleen is a package for ingesting formal natural language data from the discourse of professional and amateur writers, like bloggers and news outlets, in a categorized fashion. Minke extends Baleen with a library that performs parallel data loading, preprocessing, normalization, and keyphrase extraction to support machine learning on a large-scale custom corpus.</div>

Some of them are quite easy for using: a developer can read, for example, about f-strings and they can start using them in their programs as soon as possible. But sometimes features are not so evident, and a new frame evaluation API is one of them.  
The new frame evaluation API was introduced to CPython in PEP 523 and it allows to specify a per-interpreter function pointer to handle the evaluation of frames. It might not be evident how to use this new feature in everyday life, but it’s quite easy to understand how to build a fast debugger based on it.  
In this talk we are going to explain how standard way of debugging in Python works and how a new frame evaluation API may be useful for creating the fast debugger. Also we will consider why such fast debugging was not possible in the previous versions of Python. If someone hasn’t made a final decision to move to Python 3.6 this talk will provide some new reasons to do it.</div>

         >Assuming that you already know how to build a monolithic app, you must be wondering how you can use all this &quot;microservice&quot; stuff that you keep hearing about. Well, a good word of advice is that you probably don&#39;t need it. If designed properly, a monolithic app should be able to scale and fit the needs of most businesses. Even so, you should keep your development as simple as possible until you have proven and solidified your business concepts. But if you do need to grow to Internet scale, then you have a long road ahead of you.

Moving from a monolithic application to microservices is a natural evolution that is often of necessity. There are several competing schools of thought that are still being battle-tested in these early days of microservice architecture. Among all the competing paradigms, most of the requirements can be agreed upon, but are mostly differentiated by the tools used to fulfill the requirements.

This talk will cover setting up the required infrastructure, and demonstrate how to migrate a sample monolithic Django application into a microservices platform.

The demo application will use the following technologies: Django, Flask, Fabric, Terraform, Ansible, CentOS, Docker, Mesos, Consul, Nginx, Pgbouncer, Kafka</div>

         >&gt; &quot;Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou
then proceed to three.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Scene 33

Python 3 has been around for more than eight years, and much of the Python
ecosystem is now available both on Python 2 and Python 3, often using a single
code base. Nonetheless, this compatibility comes at a development cost and some
library authors are considering ending support for Python 2 . These
once-python-2-compatible libraries are at risk of being upgraded on non
compatible system and cause user (and developer) frustration.

While it may seem simple to cease support for Python 2, the challenge is not in
ending support, but doing so in a way that does not wreak havoc for users who
stay on Python 2. And that is not only a communications problem, but a
technical one : up until recently, it was impossible to tag a release as Python
3 only; today it is possible.

Like any maintainer of a widely used library, we want to ensure that users
continue to use Python 2 continue to have functioning libraries, even after
development proceeds in a way that does not support Python 2. 

One approach is to ensure easy installation of older versions if possible avoid
incompatible versions altogether. Users should not need to manually pin maximal
version dependencies across their development environments and projects if all
they want is to use the latest versions of libraries that are compatible with
their system.

Even if we did expect that of users, consider what would happen when a package
they rely on converts to be only Python 3 compatible. If they were not tracking
the complete dependency tree, they might discover, on  upgrade, that their
projects no longer work. To avert this they would need to pin those at the last
version compatible with Python 2. Users that want to use older python versions
should not have to go through so much anguish to do so. 

In order to solve this problem, and thereby make both users&#39; and maintainers&#39;
lives easier, we ventured into the rabbit-hole called Packaging.

Though we set off with a singular quest, our tale roves through many lands.
We&#39;ll narrate the story of our amending PEPs, our efforts in building the
ramparts of the pypa/Warehouse Castle, battles with the dragons of Pip, and
errands in the &quot;land of no unit tests&quot; otherwise known as PyPI legacy.

By the end of the above tale, the audience members will know the road to Python
3 only libraries had once had hazards that are now easily avoidable. So long as
users upgrade their package management tools.

         >Recently, networking vendors and Silicon Valley giants have been putting forth a concerted effort to build standardized models for networking devices. These models allow for building reusable and versatile scripts with predictable, standardized data. Without such models, the wide variety of inputs and outputs required by different devices and vendors made scripting a tedious and challenging endeavor. The modeling language in use is called YANG, and a variety of standards have emerged. A vendor agnostic standard called OpenConfig has lately become stable enough to begin programming devices with it. Using Python, YANG is surprisingly easy to work with, and extremely powerful applications can be written with basic knowledge of JSON or XML and RPCs. 

The talk will start with use-cases for programming networking devices, and will detail a specific, trivial, use case that will be used in the talk. Next, we will discuss the ‘legacy’ way of programming devices (SSH and screenscraping), and highlight the challenges, such as complex regular expressions, slow responses, and lack of reusability between devices. From there we will dive into YANG, focusing on OpenConfig models. A YANG model is essentially a template, and JSON or XML can be mapped to the YANG template. This makes it perfect for Pythonic manipulation. In the use case there will be a GET RPC returning a YANG representation of the box’s state in JSON, which we will search for the relevant health indicator by drilling down in the JSON dictionary. A simple change to the dictionary will remediate the problem, and a PATCH RPC merges the new configuration onto the box. Since open, standard models are in use, this script could be run on many devices across a network to achieve the same effect with no changes needed. We will finish up with the pros and cons of YANG before opening the talk for Q&amp;A.</div>

But when your factory automates complex non-linear workflows and is jam-packed with sensors and robots, you are quickly faced with software engineering challenges that call for modern tools.

Python turns out to be surprisingly versatile in this setting, whether for prototyping a single conveyor belt or taming a building full of robots. This talk explains how to use Python for interfacing with two common industrial automation devices: a barcode scanner and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). After a simple demo, you’ll hear about lessons learned using Python packages that weren’t written with robots in mind, like Celery and pandas, with robots.</div>

In addition, outputs from OCR or voice to text conversions tend to be messy or imperfect. Thus, we want to be able to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as possible. 

In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. We will also discuss situations where it’s important to take into account the meaning or intent of a word and demonstrate approaches for measuring semantic similarity using nltk and word2vec. Furthermore, we will demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search algorithms using python and/or built-in fuzzy search functions within PostgreSQL.

_It simply turns out to be not very good_ - not helpful enough for the users who should be able to rely on it, and a depressing chore for the authors who have to maintain it.

The good news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding _how documentation works_, and what its different functions are. Structuring documentation according to those distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain.

Using real-life examples I&#39;ll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort.

         >Over the last several years, Python developers interested in data science and analytics have acquired a variety of tools and libraries that aim to facilitate analytical processes. Libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick have made tasks such as data wrangling, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization much quicker and easier. They have accomplished this by automating and abstracting away some of the more tedious, repetitive processes involved with analyzing and modeling data. 

Over the next few years, we are sure to witness the introduction of new tools that are increasingly intelligent and have the ability to automate more complex analytical processes. However, as we begin using these tools (and developing new ones), we should strongly consider the level of automation that is most appropriate for each case. Some analytical processes are technically difficult to automate, and therefore require large degrees of human steering. Others are relatively easy to automate but perhaps should not be due to the unpredictability of results or outputs requiring a level of compassionate decision-making that machines simply don’t possess. Such processes would benefit greatly from the collaboration between automated machine tasks and uniquely human ones. After all, it is often systems that utilize a combination of both human and machine intelligence that achieve better results than either could on their own. 

In this talk, we will discuss human-machine collaboration as it applies to analyzing data with Python. We will review a framework for exploratory data analysis with the goal of identifying which tasks should be automated, which tasks should not, and which tasks would benefit from a more interactive, symbiotic, and collaborative process between the human and the machine. We will explore Python libraries that we can use to build tools that allow us to perform different types of analysis. We’ll also introduce the Cultivar project, an example of a hybrid analytics tool that combines a Django framework with Javascript visualizations and Celery for task management to facilitate more efficient and effective human-machine systems for data analysis.

         >When writing an application, it is common to want to do many things at once. For web servers, this is serve multiple web requests, for GUI applications it&#39;s doing a background task whilst keeping the UI responsive. But how do we actually do that? This talk will go into how concurrency and parallelism work from the CPU, OS, and threads up, how state (data) is shared between them, and how this interacts with the functions that you, the programmer, write, and how you can write properly behaving concurrent or parallel software.</div>

         >As we all know, we should write testable code, and automated tests.  But as we also know, no test plan survives contact with the real world.  Complex, distributed systems fail in complex, distributed ways, and even the simplest web app today is a complex distributed system.  So, as our code accrues little fixes to bugs that only show up in production, our test suites eventually either become slow integration testing monstrosities that are &quot;realistic&quot; but flaky and unreliable, or useless piles of mocks which are fast and deterministic but don&#39;t give you confidence.

In this talk, we&#39;ll explore how to leverage event-driven programming, or &quot;async I/O&quot;, to structure code in such a way that its tests are fast, realistic, and reliable, even in the face of horrible race-conditions you only discover in production.

         >Working with time is not a trivial challenge. Python includes a native module in the standard library to work with it but datetime keeps being together with unicode a common source of errors. This often leads to the widespread of many other libraries in the attempt of easing the work of working with datetime. Datetime is one of those API that looks easy to use but given the many concepts around time, is it easy to get backfired if the developer has not solid knowledge about the them.

In this talk we will overview the main concepts about timestamps represented through datetime objects, the limitations on the standard library and some simple steps to try to avoid the common mistakes that everyone can fall into.

Naive datetimes (which the datetime API works by default with) are a great tool to represent calendar times, but when talking about timestamps (focus of this talk) timezones is n essential part of it and the datetime module can be tricky to use for that use cases.

We will also speak about different standards of time, time zones, Daylight Saving Times, leap seconds, serialization and datetime arithmetics.

The talk will be focused on giving the foundations that everyone knows to be able to understand and work efficiently and without making painful mistakes when dealing with time related algorithms.</div>

This is not a theoretical talk. I&#39;ll touch upon theory to give you context, but will then talk about what that means for you in practice so that you can write better libraries. I&#39;ll talk about why library UX matters, about abstraction as a general concept, about out what happens when you over/under abstract, and about some useful tips to help build friendly APIs. Meanwhile, I&#39;ll show some positive examples from libraries we know and love (flask, SQLAlchemy, Requests, etc).

Python 3.6 is faster than any other Python version on many benchmarks. We will see results of the Python benchmark suite on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

The bytecode format and instructions to call functions were redesign to run bytecode faster.

A new C calling convention, called &quot;fast call&quot;, was introduced to avoid temporary tuple and dict. The way Python parses arguments was also optimized using a new internal cache.

Operations on bytes and encodes like UTF-8 were optimized a lot thanks to a new API to create bytes objects. The API allows very efficient optimizations and reduces memory reallocations.

Some parts of asyncio were rewritten in C to speedup code up to 25%. The PyMem_Malloc() function now also uses the fast pymalloc allocator also giving tiny speedup for free.

Finally, we will see optimization projects for Python 3.7: use fast calls in more cases, speed up method calls, a cache on opcodes, a cache on global variables.</div>

This requires us to ship our software, and all of its dependencies, to a variety of systems all with different web servers, Python versions, package managers,and underlying packages.

         >Exception handling in Python can sometimes feel like a Wild West. If you have a `send_email` function, and the caller inputs an invalid email address, should it:
A) Return `None` or some other special return value,
B) Let the underlying exception it might cause bubble up,
C) Check via a regex and type checking and raise a `ValueError` immediately, or
D) Make a custom `EmailException` subclass and raise that? 

What if there is a network error while the email was sending? Or what if the function calls a helper `_format_email` that returns an integer (clearly wrong!), or raises an `TypeError` itself? Should it crash the program or prompt a retry? 

This talk will introduce the concept of an exception, explain the built-in Python exception hierarchy and the utility of custom subclasses, demonstrate try/except/finally/else syntax, and then explore different design patterns for exception control flow and their tradeoffs using examples. It will also make comparisons to error handling philosophy in other languages, like Eiffel and Go.</div>

Learning to do this well is difficult, especially for those who are new to Python and might not know where to begin or what questions to ask. While there is no “right way” to set up a development environment or application, understanding the components involved and how they interact can empower you to customize your setup to best suit your needs. This talk will dive into what happens when setting up a database, the purpose and configuration of an isolated environment, how Python packages are installed, and finally, how each of these components interact with each other and the application itself; in particular, how an application&#39;s structure facilitates said interactions.

         >Bayesian statistics offers robust and flexible methods for data analysis that, because they are based on probability models, have the added benefit of being readily interpretable by non-statisticians. Until recently, however, the implementation of Bayesian models has been prohibitively complex for use by most analysts. But, the advent of probabilistic programming has served to abstract the complexity of Bayesian statistics, making such methods more broadly available. PyMC3 is a open-source Python module for probabilistic programming that implements several modern, computationally-intensive statistical algorithms for fitting Bayesian models, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference. PyMC3’s intuitive syntax is helpful for new users, and the reliance on Theano for much of the computational work has allowed developers to keep the code base simple, making it easy to extend the software to meet analytic needs. PyMC3 itself extends Python&#39;s powerful &quot;scientific stack&quot; of development tools, which provide fast and efficient data structures, parallel processing, and interfaces for describing statistical models.  </div>

In the end this is accomplished using a little algebra, a little geometry, and a healthy dose of Python.

That is, I will present a case study of using Python in several aspects of a mathematical visualization project, from the computation itself, to transforming and converting data, and finally for scripting the process of generating the images.  Along the way I&#39;ll explain how Python&#39;s convenient idioms and containers (e.g. sets and set comprehensions) are a good fit for some of the algebraic and geometric questions that come up, how Scipy and Numpy enable fast numerical calculations, and how Python&#39;s strength as a language for scripting and automation allows easy orchestration of rendering of still images and frames of animations.

Of course, the truth is more complex than that. Real software that deals with real problems is rarely ideal: there are edge cases, terrible hacks, and awkward workarounds for problems.

Often in the software industry we pretend that these imperfections in our software don’t exist, or we try to hide them. These imperfections frequently cause people to reinvent wheels in order to simplify the code, which has benefits for understandability but frequently has downsides for resilience. When people talk about “battle-tested” code, they mean code that has been dirtied up over time from its original Platonic ideal implementation to something that is just as complex and warty as real life.

In this talk, one of the Requests and urllib3 core maintainers lays bare all of the worst and hackiest corners of the codebases of these two libraries. The goal is to help expose all of the invisible work done in mature codebases to tolerate edge cases and misbehaviour, as well as to try to remind us all that the perfect is the enemy of the good.

         >Companies with an artificial-intelligence plan have a differentiating strategy in the intelligence economy; however, implementing robust machine-learning in production is nontrivial, often requiring a close collaboration between data scientists and developers, and retooling the production stack and workflows to develop and maintain accurate models.  

Machine learning in production involves model application, handling missing data, data artifacts, and data outside of the training calibration.  A rigorous evaluation framework draws upon logging to determine characteristics of model coverage, model performance, auditing, and run-time performance.  Model coverage includes the number of times the model produced sensible output relative to number of times it is called.  Model coverage is reduced if the model does not converge or model criteria are not met.  Model performance is evaluated with a suite of metrics (accuracy, AUC, FPR, TPR, RMSE, MAPE, etc.), which assist in determining the most appropriate model to use in the production scenario and the validity of the model training.  Regularly performing manual audits for spot checks is important for debugging and ensuring the model passes sanity checks.  Model performance includes run times and profiling model pieces, ensuring performance is within specified requirements and refactoring otherwise.

In the AI renaissance, where ML is a critical piece of intelligent products, seamlessly integrating model evaluation into workflows is an important component of making robust products and building a satisfying customer experience.  Python is a great language to build intelligent products with its abundance of ML libraries and wrappers contributed as open-source software in addition to rich full-stack capabilities.

         >SQLAlchemy ([http://www.sqlalchemy.org](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)) and Postgres ([https://www.postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/)) provide several useful tools that allow us to build and query records through time: _temporal models_. Combining a need to have robust auditing, as well feature development on per-property history, we can turn “regulatory overhead” into an exciting technical challenge. At Clover Health we have built a small library to automate the task of decorating a model and making it “temporal.” This talk aims to demonstrate the underlying data model and interface for building this system.</div>

         >Few people realize just how complicated text can be. Did you know sorting and even case-folding can depend on a user&#39;s locale? That different strings of characters can be semantically completely equivalent? That there are over a thousand Latin letters?

Legacy text encodings like ASCII made a lot of simplifying assumptions about how written languages work, and we all put up with them because it was cool to even have computers in the first place. Unicode removes many of those assumptions and provides the tools we need to write software that can just do the right thing regardless of what text users throw at it. Even if you don&#39;t translate your UI, getting the details of string comparison, sorting, and searching right can eliminate annoying surprises for you and your users.</div>

The talk will discuss iterable views, the dictionary’s dedicated comprehension syntax, random key ordering, the special key-sharing dictionary designed to underlie object collections, and, most famously of all, the new “compact dictionary” that cuts dictionary storage substantially — and carries a fascinating side-effect.

Each new feature that the talk discusses will be motivated by considering the trade-offs inherent in hash table data structure design, and followed up with hints about how you can now use the dictionary even more effectively in your own code!

This talk will explore the internals of MicroPython and contrast it with CPython, focusing on the aspects that relate to memory use.

We will touch upon how the designs of the bytecode compiler and interpreter of each differ and why that matters.

         >The statistician John Tukey -- who designed the box plot and coined the term &quot;bit&quot; -- wrote:  &quot;An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem&quot;. Python has become one of the major languages for statistical data analysis, not least because of the expressiveness of the language itself and the availability of tools like Jupyter Notebooks, which enable iterative reasoning about a problem and its solutions. 

This talks takes one step beyond an introduction to statistics with Python and aims to familiarize the audience with two concepts: a class of problems (so-called inverse problems), and a powerful statistical tool (the random walk, or more formally Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with the Metropolis algorithm). 

In inverse problems, model parameters are estimated from observational data. Both model and data are expected to be affected by error. The objective is not only to find parameters that best describe the observations, but also to figure out how good, or how possibly bad, a solution might be. Inverse problems are extremely common in many fields and crop up each time we attempt to reconstruct a reality from sensor, radar, scattering or imaging data. 

The Metropololis-Hastings algorithm offers a solution via random sampling of a Bayesian posterior distribution. Even though listed as one of the 20th century&#39;s top 10 algorithms by the journal _Computing in Science &amp; Engineering_, the Metropolis algorithm is easy to understand and implement, and a fun and instructive way to explore even complicated multi-variate probability distributions. </div>

Therefore from the above mentioned introduction it very clear that it is very important for developers to choose the license for their code wisely and correctly.

PyPI, the Python Package Index is a repository of software for the Python programming language. There are currently 80000+ packages there.

This talk will go through the licenses of the top 2500 packages. We will see the trend of choosing a license for these top Python projects. We will discuss the licenses individually, compare them with each other. the advantages and disadvantages of the same.

We will further explain that why a license and/or licenses are being favored by the developers.

values are produced only when needed. Lazy evaluation is the opposite of eager
evaluation, Python&#39;s normal evaluation model, where functions are executed as
seen and values are produced immediately.

In this talk we will define lazy evaluation and contrast it with eager
evaluation. We will discuss tools that exist in Python for using lazy evaluation
and show how we can build on the primitives to better represent computations. We
will introduce common vocabulary for discussing evaluation models, and compare
different systems for implementing lazy evaluation. Finally, we will discuss
optimizations that can be made to optimize lazily evaluated expressions.

         >This talk describes the build of a C Python extension, with prebuilt binaries, in 2017, where modern packaging standards, as well as Docker, have been a game changer in the Python extensions world. Most examples come from our experience building [PyMiniRacer][1], an embedded Python / JavaScript bridge used in production across hundreds of companies.

We will describe the different aspects of building a binary extension, including:

-  using the modern manylinux wheel type in order to ship a built binary, usable in most Linux distributions;
- the choices offered to developers when building an extension: the Python public C API, cffi, ...;
- testing of a binary module across various platforms;
- troubleshooting &amp; debugging an extension: the basics you need to tackle most common issues.
