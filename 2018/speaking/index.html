&lt;b&gt;All CFPs for PyCon US 2018 have closed!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, to all participants!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

PyCon is seeking speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds to contribute to our conference program! If you use Python professionally, as a hobbyist, or are just excited about Python or programming and open source communities, we&#39;d love to hear from you. Speakers also get prioritized access to financial aid, so please don&#39;t let that be a deterrent either! We want you and your ideas at PyCon! 

We&#39;ve got lots of good information and resources below that you should read, but in case you&#39;ve already read it and want to dive in [now](/2018/dashboard/).

Here are the PyCon 2018 **Call for Proposals** deadlines:

&gt; &lt;s&gt;**Tutorial** proposals  — deadline is **24&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2017**  [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).&lt;/s&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b  style=&quot;color: #EA6446;&quot;&gt;Tutorial CFP has Closed&lt;/b&gt;

&gt; &lt;s&gt;**Talk**, **Poster**, and **Education Summit** proposals  — deadline is **3&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;2018** [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).&lt;/s&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b  style=&quot;color: #EA6446;&quot;&gt;Talk, Poster, and Education Summit CFPs have Closed&lt;/b&gt;

Part of PyCon’s purpose is to generate materials to help with Python education and advocacy all over the world, so we intend to record all PyCon presentations and release the recordings on the web. For the details, see our [PyCon Recording Release](/2018/speaking/recording/).

# Where to submit your proposal

1. Sign up for a new us.pycon.org account by clicking [here](/2018/account/signup/).

2. Head over to your dashboard available [here](/2018/dashboard/) and create a Speaker profile:

3. Finally, return to your dashboard and you should see our “Submit a new proposal” button!

Due to the competitive selection process, we encourage prospective speakers to submit their proposals as early as possible as it allows for feedback prior to the CFP deadline.

# Guidelines for Proposal Submission

Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal, regardless of experience level.  PyCon thrives on having talks ranging from introductory to advanced. If you are reading this, and you are interested in speaking at PyCon, we want *you* to submit a proposal. 

Before writing up a proposal, read the following descriptions of the three kinds of presentation at PyCon — Talks, Tutorials, and Posters — and follow the “Learn more” links for the kind that best suits your topic.

PyCon does not want expenses to discourage you from submitting a proposal, and offers speaker grants ensure that anyone can speak at PyCon. When you create a speaker profile, check the box to indicate that you require a speaker grant. This is not seen by the proposal reviewers and does not affect the review of your proposal. 

After proposals are selected, we&#39;ll reach out to you regarding your needs. We understand situations can change, and are here for you. If you have any questions let us know at [pycon-aid@python.org](mailto:pycon-aid@python.org)

## Talks

These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days, **Friday through Sunday, May&amp;nbsp;11–May&amp;nbsp;13.**

PyCon is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive mix of speakers in the lineup.

All speakers are expected to have read and adhere to the conference [Code of Conduct](/2018/about/code-of-conduct/). In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size.

We will make every effort to provide accommodations for speakers and attendees of all abilities—all we ask is that you let us know so we can prepare accordingly.

Most talks are **30 minutes long**, but we do offer a limited number of 45-minute slots for important topics that promise to benefit from a more extensive treatment. We organize the schedule into five &quot;tracks&quot;, grouping talks by topic and having them in the same room for consecutive sessions.

There is no official restriction on the topic that you propose for a talk session. Talks about Python or the Python community are most likely to line up with the interests of PyCon&#39;s audience, and a key consideration that the talk selection committee will be thinking about is your talk’s ability to draw an audience. We observe a limit of one talk per presenter. You may propose more than one, but the committee will ask you to choose only one talk if more than one of your proposals is accepted.

## Tutorials

As with the talks, we are looking for **tutorials** that can grow this community at any level. We aim for tutorials that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the future. Each tutorial session runs for 3 full hours plus a break for coffee. There is both a morning tutorial session and an afternoon tutorial session on the two days preceding the main conference — this year, the tutorial days are **Wednesday and Thursday, May 9–10** in the same venue that hosts the main conference days that follow.

_Attention full-time trainers:_ Please bring your coursework to PyCon. Every year we get several educators to bring their show on the road, so show us what you have on the syllabus for 2018.

As tutorials are longer than talks and are in an interactive classroom-like setting, they require much more preparation. Due to the amount of work involved, tutorial instructors are compensated. There is a limit of at most two tutorials given by one presenter.

## Posters

The poster session happens on the last morning of the three main conference days — this year, on the morning of **Sunday, May 13** in the same space that is occupied by the sponsor Expo Hall on the first two days of the conference.

A **poster** is a presentation of a topic on a 4′×8′ poster board. As attendees mingle through the rows, they find interesting topics, read through them, then strike up a discussion. As with the other proposal types, we are really looking to you to talk about what&#39;s going on in this community and tell everyone where it is going. If you are doing something awesome, share it!

## Education Summit

The Education Summit happens on the last day of tutorials, May 10th, 2018. 

We are looking for calls to action about how teachers and Python programmers have implemented Python instruction in their schools, communities, and other places of learning.

* Have you implemented a program that you&#39;ve been dying to talk about? 
* Have you tried something that failed but learned some great lessons that you can share? 
* Have you learned of a tool or technique that helped you teach more successfully OR helps your students learn more effectively? 

Then we urge you to submit a talk! You do NOT need to be an experienced speaker! We want you to share knowledge; we want to learn from your experiences. This year, talks that focus on the challenges and triumphs of implementing code education are especially encouraged. Please submit all talk proposals through your [dashboard](/2018/dashboard/).
