         >As the web continues to evolve, the demand for data-driven backends matched with rich frontend experiences grows every day. Django comes with a robust templating system and rendering engine, but more and more web applications using Django are just focusing on it’s API abilities.

What if we could have the best of both worlds? What if we could use Django and django-rest-framework to write views that let us prototype quickly using the Django templating system, and have those same views return API responses to rich clients?

In this tutorial, we’ll build a sample data collection and display web application, taking advantage of the ways Django and django-rest-framework work together. The end result will be a web application you could adapt for many kinds of data collection needs, and you’ll come away knowing how to get a rich API and a frontend prototype out of just one Django view.

         >Containers have more or less taken over the world of application, web APIs, mobile endpoints and other forms of deployment. They have become the currency, the &quot;table stakes&quot; and de-facto application deployment unit. Their raise to the fore has brought about a whole host of use cases which weren&#39;t practical or accessible in the world of &quot;classic&quot; paradigms of infrastructure and virtualization. Containers have also brought application deployment closer and more accessible to developers. 

But as more use cases, deployment styles and exponential adoption of containers was ongoing, a new set of problems began to surface: how do you manage the ever growing number of containers in a deployment? How do you make sure containers have the right resources, deployed to the right machine, running with the correct parameters, how do you scale in and out without disruption? How do you make sure in a fleet of X containers that they’re all running and in healthy state? Enter Kubernetes.

Initially developed internally by Google to replace their own complex container orchestration and management framework. It had to meet all the stringent standards and mind-boggling scale that Google operates on, but from the get-go an effort was made to make the learning curve and developer experience as approachable as possible. At certain point the creators made the case to Google to release kubernetes to the open source community -- a crucial decision that has helped “k8s” (as it’s commonly referred to as) reach rock star levels of fame and mind share not just in the FOSS community but also across industries and businesses from small operations to gigantic multinational corporations with thousands of deployments.

We&#39;ll extend the blog built in the official guide, using a variety of slightly more advanced Django features.  Topics to be covered include: extending the in-built user model, using the in-built login system, enhancing forms, using view mixins and overriding view methods, and changing up your database backend.  

With each extension, we&#39;ll talk about not just how to use these features but also *why* you&#39;d want to use them.  We&#39;ll conclude by talking about other Django features you may want to learn about as you grow more proficient with this versatile framework.</div>

Learn how to automate your workflow by building a personal GitHub assistant for your own project. We&#39;ll use libraries called `gidgethub` and `aiohttp` to write a GitHub bot that does the following:

- Greet the person who created an issue in your project. 

- Say thanks when a pull request has been closed.

- Apply a label to issues or pull requests.

- Gives a thumbs up reaction to comments **you** made. (becoming your own personal cheer squad).
 
The best part is, you get to do all of the above using Python 3.6! F-strings included!

There are a few well-developed visualization packages in Python, but they often have very imperative APIs that force the user to focus on the mechanics of the visualization – tick locations, axis limits, legends, etc. – rather than the salient relationships within the data.

This tutorial will introduce data visualization with [Altair](http://altair-viz.github.io), a package designed for exploratory visualization in Python that features a declarative API, allowing data scientists to focus more on the data than the incidental details. Altair is based on the [Vega](https://vega.github.io/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualization grammars, and thus automatically incorporates best practices drawn from recent research in effective data visualization.

         >Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory. Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.
Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.

Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages
for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce
program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start?

This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how
to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.
You will experience that one&#39;s gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.

The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is
important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.

Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.


## Software Requirements

You will need Python 2.7 or 3.6 installed on your laptop. Python 2.6 or 3.4/3.5
should also work. Python 3.x is strongly preferred. If released, we will use Python 3.7.


### Jupyter Notebook

I will use a Jupyter Notebook for the tutorial because it makes a very good
teaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,
REPL. If you also like to use a Jupyter Notebook, I recommend `conda` for
easy installation. Similarly to `virtualenv`, `conda` allows creating isolated
environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install `Jupyter` via `conda`:

1. Use [Minconda][1]. This is a  small install and (after you installed it)
   you can use the command  `conda` to create an environment:
  `conda create -n pycon2018 python=3.6`
   Now you can change into this environment:
   `source activate pycon2018`. The prompt should change to `(pycon2018)`.
   Now you can install IPython: `conda install Jupyter`.

2. Install [Anaconda][2] and you are ready to go if you don&#39;t mind installing
   lots of packages from the scientific field.

### Working witch `conda` environments

After creating a new environment, the system might still work with some
stale settings. Even when the command `which` tells you that you are using an
executable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.
If you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,
use ``hash -r`` and try again.


### Tools

You can install these with `pip` (in the active `conda` environment with `conda`):

* [SnakeViz][3]
* [line_profiler][4]
* [Pympler][6]
* [memory_profiler][7]

         >Python is one of the world&#39;s most popular programming languages for numerical
computing. In areas of application like physical simulation, signal processing,
predictive analytics, and more, engineers and data scientists increasingly use
Python as their primary tool for working with numerical large-scale data.

Despite this diversity of application domains, almost all numerical programming
in Python builds upon a small foundation of libraries. In particular, the
`numpy.ndarray` is the core data structure for the entire PyData ecosystem, and
the `numpy` library provides many of the foundational algorithms used to power
more domain-specific libraries.

The goal of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to numpy -- how it
works, how it&#39;s used, and what problems it aims to solve. In particular, we
will focus on building up students&#39; mental model of how numpy works and how
**idiomatic** usage of numpy allows us to implement algorithms much more
efficiently than is possible in pure Python.

However, many people are still not very comfortable with the ideas and concepts behind the blockchain, and workings of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Therefore, it stops them from entering and exploring the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.


In this tutorial, we first explore the cryptographic ideas behind the cryptocurrencies, including hashing, public/private cryptography. This will be followed by the basics of a simplified blockchain. We cover mining, incentives, payment records, ownership, etc. Then we delve into working and playing with a private Bitcoin network, by implementing simple programs in Python to create public/private keys, accounts, and transactions. We further look into services that provide exchange rate data on cryptocurrencies and analyze the data.</div>

- What order should I write my tests and code in to avoid wasting time on blind alleys?  
- If I&#39;m using Mocks in my tests to avoid external dependencies, how do I avoid getting stuck with unwieldy, unreadable tests that don&#39;t actually tell me when things have gone wrong?
- Unit tests vs integration tests vs functional tests, which should I use when, and what are the trade-offs?

In this tutorial we&#39;ll work through an example of using an existing Django codebase, adding a new feature, and experimenting with different testing techniques along the way to illustrate the pros and cons of each

- bottom-up vs outside-in development
- double-loop TDD
- using Mocks to isolate application layers from each other
- &quot;listen to your tests&quot;, and learning to use ugly or convoluted tests as a signal for improving design.

Some familiarity with Django is desirable, although skills learned in other web frameworks are transferrable.  By the end, you&#39;ll be able to go back to your own projects with practical experience, and a new way of thinking about how to optimise your tests for your own circumstances.

This tutorial walks through Processing.py from the ground up––from initial setup &amp; foundational concepts, to the library&#39;s core functions, as well as its more advanced features. Topics covered include the coordinate system, shape primitives, lines, stroke, fill, color, mapping, events, and transforms. At the end, we&#39;ll break out of the tutorial format and give free reign for attendees to create, tinker, and experiment freely with the framework.

You’ll walk away with an art piece of your own original design, as well as a newfound appreciation for Python as a medium for creative expression. </div>

         >The libraries that power data analysis in Python are essentially limited to a single CPU core and to datasets that fit in RAM. Attendees will see how dask can parallelize their workflows, while still writing what looks like normal python, NumPy, or pandas code.

Dask is a parallel computing framework, with a focus on analytical computing. We&#39;ll start with `dask.delayed`, which helps parallelize your existing Python code. We’ll demonstrate `dask.delayed` on a small example, introducing the concepts at the heart of dask like the *task graph* and the *schedulers* that execute tasks. We’ll compare this approach to the simpler, but less flexible, parallelization methods available in the standard library like `concurrent.futures`.

Attendees will see the high-level collections dask provides for writing regular Python, NumPy, or Pandas code that is then executed in parallel on datasets that may be larger than memory. These high level collections provide a familiar API, but the execution model is very different. We&#39;ll discuss concepts like the GIL, serialization, and other headaches that come up with parallel programming. We’ll use dask’s various schedulers to illustrate the differences between multi-threaded, multi-processes, and distributed computing.

Dask includes a distributed scheduler for executing task graphs on a cluster of machines. We’ll provide each person access to their own cluster.</div>

Let me show you how to utilize existing libraries to lock down you API without writing a ton of code.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to write a secure API with future proof security utilizing JOSE. JOSE is a collection of complimentary standards: JWT, JWE, JWS, JWA, and JWK. JOSE is used by OAuth, OpenID, and others to secure communications between APIs and consumers. Now you can use it to secure your API.</div>

         >This tutorial is for those who&#39;ve been using Python for a while and would consider themselves at an intermediate level but are looking to get to the next level.

We&#39;ll explore core language features, and also look a bit under the hood to understand and learn not to fear bytecode, monkey patching, decorators, and metaclasses.

In many ways Python is very similar to other programming languages. However, in a few subtle ways it is quite different, and many software developers new to Python, after their initial successes, hit a plateau and have difficulty getting past it. Others don&#39;t hit or perceive a plateau, but still find some of Python&#39;s features a little mysterious or confusing. This tutorial will help deconstruct some common incorrect assumptions about Python.

If in your use of Python you sometimes feel like an outsider, like you&#39;re missing the inside jokes, like you have most of the puzzle pieces but they don&#39;t quite fit together yet, or like there are parts of Python you just don&#39;t get, this may be a good tutorial for you.

We&#39;ll also learn how and when we can slightly tweak our comprehensions to turn them into more performant generator expressions.

We will learn some tricks for figuring out which of our &quot;for&quot; loops can be rewritten as comprehensions and which cannot.  We will focus heavily on **code readability and code clarity** and we&#39;ll discuss when comprehensions help readability and when they hurt.

All new skills will be acquired through practice.  We&#39;ll work through many exercises both individually and as a group.  All students will also receive a cheat sheet which can be used for guidance during future comprehension-writing journeys.
