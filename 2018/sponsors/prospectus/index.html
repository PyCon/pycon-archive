#### Move-out
Begins on 5:00pm Saturday, May 12th. Everything needs to be cleared out by 7pm. At this point, we transform the Expo Hall into the Job Fair (details for the job fair below).

You have an option to opt-out of the Booth Space in the Exhibit Hall. However, if you do not opt-out before the start of the conference and leave your booth empty, a fee will be applied to your sponsorship. This can be arranged by contacting us at pycon-sponsors@python.org.

&lt;h2 id=“job-fair-info”&gt;Job Fair Information&lt;/h2&gt;

We always have an amazing turnout at our Job Fair. Many companies find good prospects during the three-hour event, some receiving hundreds of resumes in a short time. The job fair is open to the public, with tickets available online. This opens up new opportunities to reach the local dev scene, schools, and user groups and increases the Job Fair audience with quality candidates.

Date &amp; Time: 
  - Sunday, May 13, 2018 – 10:00am to 1:00pm
  - Active times are: 10:00am to 1:00pm

Location:

Move-in: 
  - Begins at 8:00 am Sunday, May 13. The Job Fair is open to attendees and the public from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm (3 hours). 

Move-out: 
  - Begins at 1:00pm. Sponsor material should be cleared out by 3:00pm.

Layout: 
  -Every participant will have a six-foot table and 2 chairs set reserved for them. We do not use booths during the Job Fair. You are welcome to have a standing banner or customized tablecloth. Giveaways/flyers are welcome. Power and wifi will be provided.

#### Note: The Expo Hall with booths is a different event than the Job Fair. We do not reuse the Expo Hall booths for the job fair; the entire room is reset Saturday, May 12, 2018, at 5:00 pm. Please, opt-in for either or both events during sign up.
