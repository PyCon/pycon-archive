Python Cloud Engineer - remote

About this job
Job type: Full-time
Experience level: Mid-Level, Senior, Lead
Role: Backend Developer
Industry: Cloud-Based Solutions, Continuous Delivery, PaaS
Company size: 51-200 people
Company type: VC Funded

ob description
Platform.sh is a groundbreaking hosting and development tool for web applications. We’re a European VC-Backed startup with a host of blue-chip Enterprise clients and a string of awards and grants (including €2m from the EU Horizon 2020 program). To reinforce our technical prowess, we are looking to grow our engineering team. If you’re looking for an exciting, high-growth opportunity with an award-winning, cutting-edge company, this could be just the job for you

For its groundbreaking PaaS solution https://platform.sh is looking for a Pythonian Cloud Engineer with a taste for Go, good Linux system understanding, and a real hunger for the challenges of building robust, distributed systems.

Platform.sh is a PaaS shrouded in a lot of black magic (we can consistently clone a whole running cluster, with its state, databases, indexes in a matter of seconds). We want to get this down to the hundreds of milliseconds domain. Interested? There is more...

Our external API is pure Hypermedia REST + oAuth on top of Pyramid. It mechanizes the Git layer and needs more features.

We can consistently generate from the same manifest a Docker container, an LXC one, or VM disk images (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), we want more targets.

We probably have the highest industry container density. We need to get it higher.

We support any Python, Ruby, NodeJS, PHP, Java and .NET time to roll-out Elixir, of course Elixir, and Rust.

We need to have more auto-healing on the high-availability clusters. We need more performance out of our multi-protocol ssh proxy. We need work on our Ceph Implementation; We need to get the Debian package generation streamlined and faster. We need… great ideas on how to make Platform.sh even better. Interested? Join us!

This is a remote position and occasional travel to cool places like Paris, France, may be required.

Skills &amp;amp; requirements:

Required:

Be a really really good dev that likes testing, understands how an OS works, knows networking, how git works, and the constraints of a distributed system.
Be proficient in Python (2 out of 3 of our dev team learned it while on the job, but we&#39;d prefer someone who has already mastered it.)
Would be really great if you had:

Great Golang experience.
Experience with C (we contribute to a bunch of upstream projects, like LXC) is a plus; Love not required.
Great knowledge of Git
Good Networking background (routing/protocols)
Good grasp of practical security and cryptography
Experience with other programming languages (Haskell anyone? Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP? Common Lisp?)
Good knowledge of how the Web works (Hacking Nginx with Lua a plus).
Good understanding of how database systems and search engines work
A good notion on distributed systems (consensus protocols like Raft/Paxos, eventual consistency models, gossip protocols)
Working knowledge of Puppet
Mad Debian Skills. Sporting a Debian plaid cloth during the interview is not frowned upon.</div>

                  <div class="job-listing">Backend/API Engineer, Payments

As a platform company powering businesses all over the world, Stripe processes payments, runs marketplaces, detects fraud, helps entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, builds world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more. Stripe’s backend engineers work on the business logic for all of that. As a backend engineer, you will build and expand APIs and services and work with our partners to launch new markets, payment methods, and capabilities.

We have backend engineers in almost every team across Stripe, and in that role, you’ll be making some of the most significant decisions for the company. You’ll get to work with other engineers to build delightful features that span various parts of the system, as well as our business, sales and operations teams to understand and solve our users’ pain points.

We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products or systems; you’re comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; you have exquisite attention to detail; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems.

You will:
-Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams
-Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
-Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale
-Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes

You may be fit for this role if you:
-Enjoy and have experience building APIs
-Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
-Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
-Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
-Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
-Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of -Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.

It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.

You might work on:
-Build a new API for our users, or iterate on existing APIs
-Launch a new market or payment method
-Work with our Analytics and Fraud teams to reduce chargebacks and declines
-Build new tools for our business teams
-Build new systems to securely store sensitive data</div>
