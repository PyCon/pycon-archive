PyCon Historical Archive
========================

The final resting place for PyCon websites.

In order to better preserve things, we crawl each year's PyCon website to static HTML after the conference ends.

See https://web.archive.org/web/20220926122034/https://gerg.ca/blog/post/2013/archiving-pycon/ 
for tips on producing good archival copies.
