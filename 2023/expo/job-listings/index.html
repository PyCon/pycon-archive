<p>The role
We're looking for a principal level product manager to work closely with our VP of Product, product delivery, and go-to-market teams to deliver our unique lifter-driven data product to the market. You will guide our product lifecycle from research through development and into sales and go to market planning, learning, and iteration. In this role, you will lead a critical work-stream within the company’s overall product strategy and vision. </p>
<p>Tidelift is creating a new category of solution within software supply chain security.

The ideal candidate for this role must be able to ensure a first-class user experience for our partnered maintainers, while also delivering business value for customers and prospects.</p>
<p>Principal roles at Tidelift include a mentorship element, and managing earlier career team members within the product organization is one potential growth path for this role depending on candidate interest.</p>
<p>Key responsibilities: </p>
<p>Rapidly &amp; Reliably delivering product 
Shipping small, iteratively, quickly, and clearly
Ensuring that the go-to-market team is able to understand, demo, and sell the customer pain and value proposition story from Tidelift

        </div>
        <div class="sponsor-job-listing-text">
          <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Generally Intelligent is an AI research company working directly on building human-level general machine intelligence that can learn naturally in the way humans do. Our mission is to understand the fundamentals of learning and build safe, humane machine intelligence. Here are our open roles:</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/generallyintelligent/e66a55a3-a117-406c-9b07-8ba055047cea?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=PyCon%202023" target="_blank" class=" external" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Infrastructure Engineer (San Francisco or Remote, Full-time)</a>
 This role is about enabling and supporting those large-scale compute efforts and all of the other software infrastructure that goes into making research a pleasant, seamless experience for the rest of the team, especially as we scale to increasingly higher scale systems. One benefit of this role is that, since we have no product or customers, you will not be on-call. All of our engineers are (and will continue to be) sufficiently empowered to fix their own infrastructure issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/generallyintelligent/9411e2ec-502a-403f-a39a-0d44c676b6af?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=PyCon%202023" target="_blank" class=" external" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Engineer (Remote, Full-time or Contract)</a>
As a remote machine learning engineer, you’ll work very closely with a senior member of our research team on cutting-edge deep learning research, infrastructure, and tooling toward the goal of creating general human-like machine intelligence.</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/generallyintelligent/c2f4a435-1eef-489a-9972-fba95e4a0296?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=PyCon%202023" target="_blank" class=" external" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Research Engineer (San Francisco, Full-time)</a>
In this role you’ll work with our researchers to do cutting-edge deep learning research—conducting experiments, creating infrastructure, and developing tooling &amp; visualizations—with the goal of developing more human-like machine intelligence.
<em>Note: This research role requires being onsite in San Francisco. If you're remote, please take a look at our Machine Learning Engineer (Remote) role, which is more engineering-heavy.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/generallyintelligent/38a93a78-fb8d-4614-bb12-b6277a7f874e?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=PyCon%202023" target="_blank" class=" external" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Senior Software Engineer (San Francisco or Remote, Full-time)</a>
Much of the work we do at Generally Intelligent is effectively pure software engineering. Our perspective is that even machine learning research ends up being about 90% software engineering, so even without any prior machine learning knowledge, there is plenty to contribute as a normal software engineer. Even most of our machine learning research tends towards the software engineering side of the spectrum, as we prefer to automate the types of work that academic researchers typically do (ex: tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with small variations in network architectures, etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/generallyintelligent/7afede07-8f22-4c49-b247-19e1a0ca6953?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=PyCon%202023" target="_blank" class=" external" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Systems Engineer (San Francisco or Remote, Full-time or Contract)</a>
As a systems engineer, you’ll work on pioneering machine learning infrastructure that enables running large numbers of experiments in parallel across local and cloud GPUs, extremely fast training, and guarantees that we can trust experiment results. This allows us to do actual science to understand, from first principles, how to build human-like artificial general intelligence. You’ll also play a role in open-sourcing infrastructure for the machine learning community.
<em>Note: No machine learning experience is required. This role is contract if you're remote, and full-time if you're onsite in San Francisco.</em></p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We started Generally Intelligent because we believe that software with human-level intelligence will have a transformative impact on the world. We’re dedicated to ensuring that that impact is a positive one.</p>
<p>We have enough funding to freely pursue our research goals over the next decade, and our backers include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, Astera Institute, and a number of private individuals who care about effective altruism and scientific research.</p>
<p>Our research is focused on agents for digital environments (ex: browser, desktop, documents), using RL, large language models, and self supervised learning. We’re excited about opportunities to use simulated data, network architecture search, and good theoretical understanding of deep learning to make progress on these problems. We take a focused, engineering-driven approach to research.</p>
