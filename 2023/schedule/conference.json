The steps of data processing, analysis, and visualisation are demonstrated and the results compared to identical results obtained from MATLAB. The strengths and weaknesses of Python and its libraries are discussed with regards to data reduction, signal processing, ease of coding, and quality of visualisation options. The wind tunnel experiments involve the use of Pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) in conjunction with a high-speed camera, a technique that allows for the determination of oxygen partial pressure on a surface in the flow.

On an annual basis, Alzheimer's costs roughly $305 Billion dollars, and by 2050, estimates project this figure to increase to as much as $1.1 Trillion per year. Most patients with Alzheimer's today are diagnosed at the mild dementia stage, only after they have already begun to experience significant memory and thinking issues. However, if the aggregate amount of all Americans alive today who will develop Alzheimer's were to be diagnosed earlier, when they have a mild cognitive impairment, it would save the US $7.9 trillion. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's, early diagnosis for Alzheimer's results in many benefits for the healthcare system, patients, and their families. In addition to the cost savings for patients and the government, early diagnosis enables patients to access treatment options earlier, allowing them to have a greater chance of benefiting from new treatments, and the possibility of enrolling in clinical trials for new therapies. Additionally, with a diagnosis, patients can choose to adjust their lifestyle habits to slow cognitive decline and maximize the time they spend with their friends and family. Thus, I decided that there needed to be a solution for aging individuals (those most susceptible to dementia) to enable them to have their cognitive health screened &amp; monitored in an innovative fashion.</p>\n<p>Syne is a screening and data processing platform for cognitive impairment monitoring.  Syne helps HCP's screen for changes in cognitive impairment as aging patients routinely get tested over time.\nThe creation of Syne involves both hardware and software components which involved the usage of an OpenBCI device, Google Collab, and WordPress to create a more comprehensive screening and data analysis platform.</p>", "conf_key": 321100, "conf_url": "https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/100/", "cancelled": false}, {"name": "Webifying UncertainSCI Using Trame", "authors": ["Jess Tate"], "contact": ["redacted"], "speakers": [{"id": 101, "name": "Jess Tate", "photo": "https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/media/speaker_photos/101_zjOHlgO.png.256x256_q85.png", "bio": "<p>Dr Jess Tate received his PhD in Bioengineering from the University of Utah in 2018.

Abnormal hemoglobin and glucose levels can result in severe diseases such as anemia and diabetes. Currently, blood components are measured invasively, which is painful and uncomfortable for patients. Non-invasive technology can overcome the foregoing shortcomings and is popular in smart healthcare. Recently, smartphones have integrated built-in sensors for developing point-of-care health tools using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. However, improvements in deep learning powered by state-of-the-art Python packages along with smartphone may assist in resolving this issue.</p>\n<p>This poster proposes an integrated pipeline to estimate hemoglobin and glucose levels from smartphone PPG signals extracted from fingertip videos, consisting of five specialized modules. Firstly, using <strong>Frame Extraction Module</strong>, the system records 10-second fingertip video using smartphone's camera. Therefore, it extracts 300 frames from 10-second fingertip video. Then,  <strong>PPG Signal Module</strong> takes the input series of frames and applies our developed PPG signal generation algorithm to identify the region of interest and calculate the PPG value for each frame. Then, PPG signal is generated from the RED channel and applied Butterworth bandpass filter to reduce motion artifacts. After that, <strong>PPG Features Module</strong> extracts characteristic features from the PPG signal, its derivative, and Fourier-transformed signals. Furthermore, <strong>Estimation Module</strong> measures blood components from extracted features using deep neural models. Finally, a <strong>Result Presenting Module</strong>, it sends results to the end-user using a smartphone-based application. </p>\n<p>This system is designed using different python packages, including \u2013 <strong>Tensorflow/Keras</strong> for deep learning, <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> for machine learning, <strong>OpenCV</strong> for image processing, <strong>Scipy</strong> for signal processing, <strong>Minepy</strong> for MIC feature selection, <strong>Chaquopy</strong> for integration with Android Studio.

After getting several times of assistance in production debugging with it, I have added more features to help tracking the above issues of asyncio apps running in production: task creation tracker and termination tracker. These trackers keeps the stack traces whenever a new task is created or terminated, and provides a holistic view of chained stack traces when the tasks are nested with arbitrary depths.</p>\n<p>aiomonitor-ng also demonstrates a rich async TUI (terminal UI) based on prompt toolkit and Click, with auto-completion of commands and arguments, far enhancing the original version\u2019s simple REPL.</p>\n<p>With the improved aiomonitor-ng, I could successfully debug several production bugs.

En esta charla, discutiremos las formas en que podemos cooperar dentro de la comunidad de Python en movimientos que se pueden realizar tanto a nivel local como fuera de nuestro pa\u00eds de forma voluntaria.\nPara empezar, discutiremos qu\u00e9 es contribuir a la comunidad y las diferentes formas en que puede contribuir. Adem\u00e1s, explicaremos un poco sobre Python Software Foundation y sus grupos de trabajo, el papel de estos grupos y c\u00f3mo proceder si est\u00e1 interesado en ponerse en contacto y ayudar. Destacaremos el trabajo del grupo de Diversidad e Inclusi\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n el grupo de trabajo de traducci\u00f3n y su importancia para la comunidad en general.\nTambi\u00e9n se presentar\u00e1n algunos trabajos que est\u00e1n en proceso, como el trabajo masivo de nuestros colegas latinoamericanos con Python en Espa\u00f1ol, que tiene un grupo de Discord y un grupo de Telegram para estudiar y cooperar juntos. Otro caso de \u00e9xito que se presentar\u00e1 es que el encuentro brasile\u00f1o Python Python Brasil se esforz\u00f3 durante 2020 y 2021 debido a la cooperaci\u00f3n internacional: una mujer brasile\u00f1a que coopera con EuroPython 2020 nos abri\u00f3 el camino.\nHablaremos de lo importante que es ver a alguien como nosotros, que habla el mismo idioma que nosotros, ocupando estos espacios y llevando nuestras inquietudes a otras mesas de discusi\u00f3n. Y que si no hay alguien que se parezca a nosotros, hay un lugar que podemos ocupar.</p>", "authors": ["D\u00e9bora Azevedo"], "speakers": [{"id": 133, "name": "D\u00e9bora Azevedo", "photo": "https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/media/speaker_photos/133_c7tQQST.png.256x256_q85.jpg", "bio": "<p>High school teacher, holding a bachelor degree in IT and a masters in Innovation in Educational.

The C implementation, proposed in PEP 305, defines a core tokenizer that has been a reference for many subsequent projects. Two commonly needed features, however, were not addressed in <code>csv.reader()</code>: determining type per column, and converting strings to those types (or columns to arrays). Pandas <code>read_csv()</code> implements automatic type conversion and realization of columns as NumPy arrays (delivered in a DataFrame), with performance good enough to be widely regarded as a benchmark. Pandas implementation, however, does not support all NumPy dtypes. While NumPy offers <code>loadtxt()</code> and <code>genfromtxt()</code> for similar purposes, the former (recently re-implemented in C) does not implement automatic type discovery, while the latter (implemented in Python) suffers poor performance at scale.</p>\n<p>To support reading delimited files in StaticFrame (a DataFrame library built on an immutable data model), I needed something different: the full configuration options of Python's <code>csv.reader()</code>; optional type discovery for one or more columns; support for all NumPy dtypes; and performance competitive with Pandas <code>read_csv()</code>.</p>\n<p>Following the twenty-year tradition of extending <code>csv.reader()</code>, I implemented <code>delimited_to_arrays()</code> as a C extension to meet these needs. Using a family of C functions and structs, Unicode code points are collected per column (with optional type discovery), converted to C-types, and written into NumPy arrays, all with minimal <code>PyObject</code> creation or reference counting. Incorporated in StaticFrame, performance tests across a range of DataFrame shapes and type heterogeneity show significant performance advantages over Pandas. Independent of usage in StaticFrame, <code>delimited_to_arrays()</code> provides a powerful new resource for converting CSV files to NumPy arrays. This presentation will review the background, architecture, and performance characteristics of this new implementation.</p>", "authors": ["Christopher Ariza"], "speakers": [{"id": 9, "name": "Christopher Ariza", "photo": "https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/media/speaker_photos/9_BWYyJtU.jpg.256x256_q85.jpg", "bio": "<p>Christopher Ariza is Partner and Chief Technology Officer at Research Affiliates, a global leader in investment strategies and research.

This session will equip you with the skills to make customized visualizations using Python.</p>\n<h4>Section 1: Getting Started With Matplotlib</h4>\n<p>While there are many plotting libraries to choose from, the prolific Matplotlib library is always a great place to start. Since various Python data science libraries utilize Matplotlib under the hood, familiarity with Matplotlib itself gives you the flexibility to fine tune the resulting visualizations (e.g., add annotations, animate, etc.). Moving beyond the default options, we will explore how to customize various aspects of our visualizations. Afterward, you will be able to generate plots using the Matplotlib API directly, as well as customize the plots that other libraries create for you.</p>\n<h4>Section 2: Moving Beyond Static Visualizations</h4>\n<p>While static visualizations are limited in how much information they can show, animations make it possible for our visualizations to tell a story through movement of the plot components (e.g., bars, points, lines), which can encode another dimension of the data. In this section, we will focus on creating animated visualizations before moving on to create interactive visualizations in the next section.</p>\n<h4>Section 3: Building Interactive Visualizations for Data Exploration</h4>\n<p>When exploring our data, interactive visualizations can provide the most value.

Originally, this was configured manually. </p>\n<p>As our customer base grew, we noticed that heavier and longer tasks were grabbing all the resources and causing unacceptable queues in our pipeline. Moreover, some of the heavier tasks required significantly more memory, leading to OOM kills and infrastructure issues.</p>\n<p>If we could classify tasks by their expected duration and memory requirements, we could have segregated tasks in Celery based on these properties and thus minimized interruptions to the rest of the pipeline. However, the variance in the size and granularity of the fetched data made it impossible to classify if a task was about to take one minute or one hour.</p>\n<p>Our challenge was: how do we categorize these tasks, accurately and automatically?

Beginners will learn about dynamic DAG factories, and intermediate developers will learn how to scale DAG factories to thousands of DAGS \u2014 which is something Airflow can\u2019t do out of the box. </p>\n<p>After this talk and live demo, people will learn best practices (including access to a code repo) that will allow them to scale to thousands of DAGs and spend more time having fun with big data.</p>", "authors": ["Calvin Hendryx-Parker"], "speakers": [{"id": 77, "name": "Calvin Hendryx-Parker", "photo": "https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/media/speaker_photos/77_3PvCXYQ.png.256x256_q85.png", "bio": "<p>Calvin Hendryx-Parker is the co-founder and CTO of Six Feet Up, a Python and Cloud expert consulting company that makes the world a better place by accelerating tech leaders\u2019 impact.
