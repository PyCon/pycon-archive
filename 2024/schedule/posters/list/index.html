    <div class="description"><p>Scientific endeavors cannot be completed in isolation from the literature. Seminal articles serve to maintain and further motivate project development in terms of knowledge, relevance, structure and methodology. Determining key articles to include in a literature review for a project is not a simple task for aspiring researchers in academia. The prevention of knowledge diffusion may also be due to the use of jargon and esoteric writing styles that are meaningful only to seasoned factions of the field, especially when keywords shift over time.</p>
<p>To address these challenges and promote inclusively in various areas of research, we introduce BeagleTM, a robust user-friendly Python-based literature text mining tool. BeagleTM creates visual and interactive "Relationship Networks" to display user-requested information from articles, as networked to other articles sharing overlapping knowledge. Such networks therefore allow for the discovery of articles related to the project's topic, while providing associations to other related articles. To create Relationship Networks users provide BeagleTM with specific keywords to text mine throughout a corpus of millions of peer-reviewed published articles.</p>
<p>BeagleTM also provides visual "Connectivity Networks", to provide a quick overview on the number of interconnected articles from the literature containing coverage of specific or popular keywords across the literature. Connectivity Networks are particularly helpful to novice researchers to assess the level of research that likely exists in the corpus concerning their supplied keywords. Using BeagleTM, aspiring researchers are assisted in discovering and locating project-relevant articles, while ascertaining the associated works that could motivate their research project with effective literature reviews.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Funix effortlessly transforms your Python functions or classes into web apps. By extracting type hints from the signature of a function, Funix generates the GUI according to a type-to-widget mapping defined in a theme (such as the default theme). With Funix, developers can turn existing code into apps with no or minimal effort. Like CSS to HTML or macros to LaTeX, Funix separates appearance from content for convenience, manageability, and consistency. All UI-related configurations, whether a theme or per-app/function settings, are declaratively handled via JSON strings outside the core logic.</p>
<p>Funix ingeniously leverages the features and the ecosystem of Python. For example, the Python native types <code>str</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>Literal</code>, and <code>range</code> are mapped into the following UI widgets respectively: an input box, a checkbox, a set of radio buttons, and a slider. It further maps the popular data science types <code>pandas.DataFrame</code> and <code>matplotlib.figure.Figure</code> into tables and charts. It redirects Python's native <code>print()</code> function to the frontend for conveniently adding contents on the web and uses <code>yield</code> for streaming outputs. As a result, Developers can stick to their coding habits or knowledge without a steep Funix learning curve. </p>
<p>Funix can be used in many use cases. Anyone, especially startup teams, can use Funix to quickly build demos, collect user feedback, and iterate their MVPs. STEM researchers can use Funix to build in-browser playgrounds of their models and/or algorithms, or data viewers of their data. Educators can use Funix to vitalize functions/classes for students to play with the code without calling a function in daunting terminals. </p>

    <div class="description"><p>Automatic biomedical image segmentation plays an important role in speeding up disease detection and diagnosis. The rapid development of Deep Learning technology has shown ground-breaking improvements in many fields. However, the task of medical diagnosis is challenging because it is much more sensitive and vulnerable to mistakes. The stakes are high since people's lives can be at risk.  An AI-powered first response tool can come in handy in the absence of, or in conjunction with, an experienced health expert. </p>
<p>This poster proposes an integrated pipeline to diagnose various kinds of disease from different modalities of images. Currently, the system supports five types of images including Chest X-ray, Dermoscopy, Microscopy, Ultrasound, and MRI images. First, the <strong>Image Input Module</strong> takes an image and performs the necessary preprocessing steps. The image is then passed as input to the <strong>Segmentation Module</strong>. The module is composed of <strong>CNL-UNet</strong>, a lightweight deep-learning image segmentation model. The model marks the <strong>affected region</strong> or <strong>region of interest</strong> in the image. Additionally, the model gives a higher accuracy <strong>error correction information</strong> for the segmentation output. Combining these two, the system gets more confidence in the decision on the topic of interest. Finally, in a <strong>Report Generation Module</strong>, considering positions of the region of interest, the area of affected localities, and the confidence score as the inputs, it generates a final medical report using fuzzy inference.</p>
<p>This system is designed using different Python packages e.g., - <strong>OpenCV</strong> for image processing, <strong>Tensorflow/Keras</strong> for deep learning, <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> for machine learning,  <strong>SkFuzzy</strong> for fuzzy inference, and <strong>PyQt5</strong> for desktop environment of the system. We believe this poster will exhibit the effective utilization of Python open-source packages in developing a robust medical diagnosis tool and allow us to connect with similarly interested Python practitioners.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>While Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) is critical to global computing infrastructure, the maintenance of widely-adopted FLOSS packages is dependent on volunteer developers who select their own tasks. The misalignment of community engineering supply and project demands --- known as underproduction --- has led to code base decay and subsequent cybersecurity incidents such as the Heartbleed and Log4Shell vulnerabilities. Although some prior work suggests that becoming a more formal organization decreases project risk, other work suggests that engineering formalization may actually increase the likelihood of project abandonment. We evaluate the relationship between underproduction and formality, focusing on organizational structure, developer responsibility, and work processes management. Analyzing 182 Python-language GNU/Linux packages made available via the Debian distribution, we find that although more formal community structures are associated with higher underproduction, elevated developer responsibility is associated with less underproduction; the relationship between formal work process management and underproduction is not statistically significant. Our analysis suggests that a FLOSS organization's structural formalization may provoke unintended and diverging consequences which must be carefully managed. We hope that such analyses can assist FLOSS projects in processes of community maturation.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Given a diverse, complex codebase spanning multiple projects, application domains, and/or development teams, is there an optimal repository granularity to manage it as it grows larger and more complex over time?</p>
<p>This is a question that, in some form or another, will be familiar to many software maintainers. Though it is often framed in terms of a "monorepo vs multirepo" binary, the choice of how to best version, release, and distribute the code can be seen as a spectrum between fewer, larger, cohesive repos (with "one single monorepo, no matter its size" as one end); and higher number of smaller, independent repos (with "hundreds of teeny-tiny repos, as small as they can be" as the opposite end).</p>
<p>However, as it is often the case when presented with such apparent dilemmas, the solution has less to do with finding "the" best answer, and more with building effective ways of framing the problem and thinking about its tradeoffs in the context of each unique situation.</p>
<p>In our experience as maintainers of a open-source research software ecosystem, we have found the analogy between 
"stagecoaches" and "horses" effective in presenting the types of decisions that arise when evaluating "monorepos" and "multirepos". The poster presents these scenarios as illustrated cartoons, helping setting the stage for discussion and conversations for maintainers and developers to share their experiences.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Multilabel classification is a machine learning task where each instance in a dataset is assigned to multiple labels. This is in contrast to traditional classification, where each instance is assigned to a single label. Multilabel classification has gained popularity in recent years due to its expanding use in a variety of applications across domains.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges in multilabel classification is the high dimensionality of the data, which can make it difficult for machine learning algorithms to learn effectively. This is where feature selection comes in. Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant and non-redundant features from a larger set of features. It is a critical preprocessing step that can improve the performance and efficiency of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>One of the recent developments in feature selection is the Black Hole algorithm, which is inspired by the phenomenon of black holes in space. The Black Hole algorithm is a metaheuristic that iteratively removes the least relevant features from a dataset, based on a relevance measure such as mutual information. In this talk, we present a modified standalone Black Hole algorithm that incorporates genetic algorithm operators, such as crossover and mutation, to improve its performance in solving multilabel classification problems. The hybridization of Black Hole and Genetic Algorithms has shown to be effective in solving multilabel classification problems in different domains.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Traditionally, large datasets from wind tunnel experiments have been processed and visualised using MATLAB. However, there is a need of an open-source alternative to make such tools accessible to a wider community, particularly to young scientists and engineers. In this talk, large experimental datasets obtained in a wind tunnel at a flow speed of Mach 7, i.e. seven times the speed of sound, are analysed and visualised using Python. The steps of data processing, analysis, and visualisation are demonstrated and the results compared to identical results obtained from MATLAB. The strengths and weaknesses of Python and its libraries are discussed with regards to data reduction, signal processing, ease of coding, and quality of visualisation options. The wind tunnel experiments involve the use of Pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) in conjunction with a high-speed camera, a technique that allows for the determination of oxygen partial pressure on a surface in the flow. An area of interrogation of 140 mm x 37 mm is coated with PSP and tested with upstream injection of air, nitrogen, and helium. A relative concentration, ranging from 0% to 100%, is constructed in a pixel-by-pixel fashion from the high-speed videos. The video data are treated with a stabilisation algorithm to remove the jitter that stems from the tunnel’s movement during the experiments. The data are then sent through several signal processing loops to reduce the noise. The aim of this poster is to demonstrate that Python and its libraries are capable of producing scientific quality visualisation of aerodynamics or wind tunnel data and persuade researchers, teachers, and students in this field to utilise this open-source resource.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>As technology evolves, cybercriminals pose several security threats within cyberspace through various modes of cyberattacks. Hackers openly share knowledge and hacking tools within dark and surface web forums and marketplace. Additionally, cybercriminals buy, sell, and trade hacked or stolen data in these forums. In this research, we apply machine learning techniques and qualitative text analysis to automatically classify and cluster hacker forums, users, and topics using topic models and networks. We begin with automatically classifying topics and key users, then select sample topics and representative texts for in-depth analysis using qualitative methods. Results show that hacker forums discuss hacking tools and tutorials, antivirus, passwords, source codes, learning programming languages, and selling stolen data. Our project demonstrates the significance of applying real-time Python text and network analysis techniques to analyze, classify, detect, and monitor threat activities, actors and networks, emerging operations, tactics, and trends from hacker forums for cybersecurity and cyber threat intelligence.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>In Fall 2023, volunteers from USDigitalResponse.org entered into a collaboration with the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS.gov) and The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS.gov) to support Federal Open Source Projects. What originally began as a project to create an Open Source Runbook specifically for the https://beta.grants.gov API Community, was then ‘spun-out’ into a generalized set of templates and scripts based upon a Repository Maturity Model to help projects standardize their repo content and practices. </p>
<p>Our maturity model is a method for formally assessing the status of an open source project based on Repository Hygiene metrics such as whether certain goals, policies, practices are in place, and levels of community activity.</p>
<p>Most healthy open source repositories have certain elements in common, such as a README, a LICENSE, and other files. Checklists and templates can be used to ensure that a repository meets these general standards, and automated tooling can be used to create and regularly assess repository health on an ongoing basis. USDR and CMS worked together to develop a suite of tools, python scripts, CLIs, GitHub workflows, and documentation resources to enable this type of automation in the repo-scaffolder project (https://github.com/dsacms/repo-scaffolder.) </p>
<p>We are sharing our maturity models and associated tooling in hopes that other open source projects, program offices, and organizations can benefit from understanding how our federal agency values repository health, and in our opinion, what metrics and practices are important to a healthy repository. The healthier our repository ecosystem is, the less risk we face when depending on each other’s work, and the easier it is for us all to work together and contribute in Harmony. https://github.com/dsacms/repo-scaffolder/blob/main/maturity-model-tiers.pdf</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>With more libraries to easily train models or run hypothesis tests in python, it is increasingly easy to jump straight into analysis without actually understand what is in a dataset. In part, this is because much of data exploration today is still very manual. Analysts have to spend time crafting one off visualizations just to get an overview of their data and discover potential issues. With this poster, I will discuss the idea of profiling your data with fast, interactive tools to augment a normal analysis workflow in python. Rather than examining program runtime, the goal of data profiling is to help you understand the essence of your data over the course of an analysis. </p>
<p>I will present the design and implementation of our research to develop the open-source tool AutoProfiler, which is an extension to Jupyter Lab that watches for pandas dataframes in memory and shows data profiles automatically. These data profiles provide a starting point to understand what is in a dataframe to guide next steps in analysis, and importantly, alert users of potential issues in their dataset before these issues make it into downstream models or jeopardize the results of analysis. I will describe the results from several academic studies of our tool that demonstrate how using interactive data profilers can help users discover dataset insights and issues. Finally, I will discuss some of our ongoing research to extend the idea of data profiling beyond tabular data to other types of datasets like text data that are particularly hard to profile. </p>
<p>This poster will be relevant for people who do data work in python will learn about the importance of profiling their data, what sorts of issues to check for in their data, and how tools like AutoProfiler can help make this process easier.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>This project describes and evaluates a novel active learning approach for incrementally improving the accuracy of a Natural Language Processing (NLP), while optimizing for gender-equitable outcomes in healthcare systems. The approach employs an iterative cyclic model, incorporating data annotation using NLP, human auditing to improve the annotation accuracy especially for data with demographic segmentation, testing on new data (with intentional bias favoring underperforming demographics), and a loopback system for retraining the model and applying it on new data.</p>
<p>We describe experimental integration of the audit tool with distinct NLP tasks in two separate contexts: i.) annotation of medical symptoms collected in Hausa and English languages based on responses to a research questionnaire about health access in Northern Nigeria; ii.) message intent classification in English and Swahili languages based on spontaneous user messages to a health guide chatbot in both Nigeria and Kenya.</p>
<p>Baseline results showed an equity gap in both precision (P) and recall (R): p=.725 and r=.676 for the over-represented class versus p=.669 and r=.651 for the under-represented class. Application of the active learning tool and workflow mitigated this gap after three increments of auditing and retraining (p=.721 and r=.760 for the under-represented class).</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that this gender-aware audit workflow is language agnostic and capable of mitigating demographic inequity while improving overall system accuracy.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>High-fidelity simulations for drones and other aerial vehicles may appear incredibly lifelike, but it is difficult to learn control procedures in a simulator and then apply them in the actual world. One explanation is that actual photos, particularly on low-power drones, provide output that differs from that produced by simulated images, ignoring for the time being the fact that, at the level relevant to machine learning, simulated worlds themselves seem somewhat different from real ones. We concentrate on employing object detectors that typically translate well from simulation to the real world to get over this constraint, and we extract characteristics from items that are identified in order to feed them into reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>The US National Park Service (NPS) has been established with a mission to protect park resources and values. Many visitors come to national parks to enjoy nature, including being immersed in the starry night sky. Natural dark sky is a critical element for natural, cultural, educational, and visitor experience reasons. However, light pollution is diminishing the quality of the night sky. Light sources from distances up to 200 miles have the potential to brighten the night. To assist national parks in the management of natural resources, the NPS Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division provides scientific, technical, and administrative support. Measuring and monitoring light pollution is the first step in preserving natural night skies in parks. We use specialized cameras to capture images of night skies and build a Python pipeline to analyze this data. The pipeline currently reads in raw images and outputs calibrated fisheye view of the night sky. Future pipeline features will include modeling the natural sky brightness to separate out light from artificial sources and deriving sky quality indicators. We are exploring an object-oriented approach for modeling the natural sky and machine-learning capability for image sorting. This pipeline will help us answer questions like how much light is coming from natural sources and how much is from artificial sources. The NPS is using Python to assess resource conditions and fulfill its mission in conserving resources unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. We also hope our open-source pipeline will benefit other scientists worldwide in preserving natural dark skies.</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>Today it is possible to obtain genome-wide transcriptome data from single cells using high-throughput sequencing. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has significantly advanced our knowledge of biological systems. The great potential of this technology has motivated computational biologists to develop a range of analysis tools. However, up until recently most analysis tools were developed in programming language R. </p>
<p>Recently, a flourishing body of python based computational tools have made it easier to robustly analyze single-cell -omics datasets in a scalable and reproducible way. Here we will dive into conducting an analysis of a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset with Scanpy and scvi-tools, two popular Python libraries for general purpose analysis tasks.</p>
<p>Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data built jointly with anndata. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference and differential expression testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with datasets of more than one million cells.
scvi-tools (single-cell variational inference tools) is a package for probabilistic modeling of single-cell omics data, built on top of PyTorch and AnnData. The package hosts implementations of several models that perform a wide range of single-cell data analysis tasks, as well as the building blocks to rapidly prototype new probabilistic models.</p>
<p>The goal of this poster is to help PyCon attendees from all backgrounds feel empowered to explore scRNA-seq data. Specifically, we hope attendees leave with the ability to:
* Understand a general workflow for dealing with scRNA-seq data
* Anticipate and avoid some of the most common pitfalls in scRNA-seq analysis
* Build intuition around the tradeoffs inherent in analytical choices
* Feel comfortable and confident working with current Python-based tools for single cell analysis
* Know where to find additional information and assistance</p></div>

    <div class="description"><p>The complexities of reverse kinematics in robotics programming and geometric optimization present substantial challenges in various industries such as manufacturing, construction, materials engineering, and health sciences. Many projects in these industries need to address both obstacles to be successful. The Geometric Optimization Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (GORLA) introduces a novel approach that will be of interest to automation specialists and machine learning practitioners in the Python community. The algorithm employs reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle both challenges simultaneously.</p>
<p>The primary objective was to train a robot arm in a virtual environment to maximize coverage within a specified area, a task which inherently attempts to solve the reverse kinematics problem and optimize the geometric configuration. The project involved the creation of a custom RL environment in the Python programming language to draw out the specific expected behaviors post-training.</p>
<p>Results show the feasibility of training a model to optimize area coverage. Validation rounds demonstrated the trained agent's superior ability to cover more area in a specified number of steps compared to a sequence of random actions. The proportion of covered area consistently exceeded that of a random agent, showcasing the efficacy of an RL model in optimizing geometric goals and orchestrating the requisite robotic movements. </p>
<p>The poster visually showcases Python's capability to manage complexity and validates the effectiveness of Python in addressing challenges within robotic and machine learning applications, thereby enhancing precision and efficiency across industries. It outlines the project's structure, methodology of using Python for high-performance computing, successful model outcomes, and potential future directions for development.</p></div>
