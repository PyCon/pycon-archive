Although some prior work suggests that becoming a more formal organization decreases project risk, other work suggests that engineering formalization may actually increase the likelihood of project abandonment. We evaluate the relationship between underproduction and formality, focusing on organizational structure, developer responsibility, and work processes management. Analyzing 182 Python-language GNU/Linux packages made available via the Debian distribution, we find that although more formal community structures are associated with higher underproduction, elevated developer responsibility is associated with less underproduction; the relationship between formal work process management and underproduction is not statistically significant. Our analysis suggests that a FLOSS organization's structural formalization may provoke unintended and diverging consequences which must be carefully managed.

The strengths and weaknesses of Python and its libraries are discussed with regards to data reduction, signal processing, ease of coding, and quality of visualisation options. The wind tunnel experiments involve the use of Pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) in conjunction with a high-speed camera, a technique that allows for the determination of oxygen partial pressure on a surface in the flow. An area of interrogation of 140 mm x 37 mm is coated with PSP and tested with upstream injection of air, nitrogen, and helium.

To assist national parks in the management of natural resources, the NPS Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division provides scientific, technical, and administrative support.

Future pipeline features will include modeling the natural sky brightness to separate out light from artificial sources and deriving sky quality indicators. We are exploring an object-oriented approach for modeling the natural sky and machine-learning capability for image sorting. This pipeline will help us answer questions like how much light is coming from natural sources and how much is from artificial sources.

The goal of this talk is to build the tools you need to launch your own interactive dashboard in Python that can help explore communities of people based on shared characteristics (e.g. programming languages, projects worked on, apps used, management structure). The data we will dig into focuses on building a better understanding of <strong>developers + users</strong> and <em>how</em> they form communities, but this could just as easily be extended to any social network.

First we will talk about the power of graph analytics and how you can use tools like NetworkX to extract information from your data, and then we will talk about how we made the machinery behind NetworkX work with heterogeneous backends like GraphBLAS (CPU optimized) and cuGraph (GPU optimized).</p>\n<h3>Part I</h3>\n<p>NetworkX is the most popular library in Python for graph theory and applied network science thanks to its extensive API and beginner-friendly documentation. NetworkX is used \"everywhere\", because graphs are everywhere. Don't believe me? We surveyed more than 300 Python packages to understand how they use NetworkX in domains ranging from geoscience, neuroscience, genomics, biology, chemistry, quantum computing, text and language, machine learning, causal inference, optimization, and more. We will summarize what we learned to help you apply graph analytics to your data.</p>\n<p>Once you start using NetworkX you will soon realize that the pure-Python implementation starts becoming a roadblock to scalable graph analytics. This takes us to the second part of the talk...</p>\n<h3>Part II</h3>\n<p>What should you do when your graph data becomes too large or NetworkX becomes too slow? Simple: use an accelerated NetworkX backend!</p>\n<p>NetworkX 3.0 added the ability to dispatch to other implementations. This means you can use other highly tuned libraries from NetworkX to achieve up to 100 to 10_000+ times speedup! As \"the API for graphs\", NetworkX now makes it easy to accelerate your graph workflows on CPUs with GraphBLAS and NVIDIA GPUs with nx-cugraph.

Biased data can lead to AI models that are unfair or discriminatory. For example, if a dataset for facial recognition software predominantly contains images of people from certain ethnic groups, the model may perform poorly on faces from underrepresented groups.\n<strong>Insufficient Data Variety:</strong> AI models require diverse data to understand different scenarios and variations. If the training data is too homogeneous or lacks variety, the model might not perform well in real-world, diverse conditions.\n<strong>Overfitting and Underfitting:</strong> Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns to fit the training data so closely that it fails to generalize to new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n<strong>Poor Data Quality:</strong> If the training data is full of errors, inconsistencies, or is poorly labeled, the AI model will likely inherit these flaws. Ensuring high data quality is essential for developing reliable and accurate AI models.\n<strong>Ignoring Data Drift:</strong> Over time, the real-world data that an AI model encounters may change or 'drift' from the data on which it was trained.

Our main river has a small watershed, so it responds rapidly to periods of heavy precipitation. Using Python, I was able to investigate the question we all kept coming back to:</p>\n<p><em>Is the correlation between changing river levels and landslide activity strong enough to serve as the basis for predicting landslides?</em></p>\n<p>Using historical readings from a local river gage, a set of conditions was identified that correlate meaningfully with landslide activity.

This tool is used by many community members to assess the ongoing risk of landslide activity during heavy rain events.

Yet in the Python podcast community, women are still underrepresented, making up only 17% of invited guests among the popular podcast series. Being a guest in a podcast is a privilege, and an opportunity to influence the Python community. There are many women and underrepresented group members who have made impactful contributions to the Python community globally, and they deserve the recognition and to be heard by the rest of us. Disheartened by the lack of representation by women on Python podcasts, and inspired by others who have shown us how diversity in the community can be improved through intentionality, we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk,earn about them, and about our podcast series. We\u2019ll also share how you can further help out cause in improving representation and diversity in the Python community. </p>\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>To raise awareness of the underrepresentation of certain groups, especially women. To acknowledge the progress made by the Python community and what can be done further to continue the improvement.</p>\n<h2>Target Audience</h2>\n<p>Anyone who cares about the diversity and inclusion progression in the Python community.
