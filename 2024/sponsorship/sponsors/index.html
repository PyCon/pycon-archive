          Endor Labs is a software supply chain security (SSCS) platform for organizations that value developer experience. We help DevSecOps teams build credibility with developer-centric tools that make it safer and faster to use OSS code, easier to detect CI/CD risks, and simpler to comply with SSCS regulations. Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) tools bury teams in uncontextualized data and tens of thousands of false positive alerts. Endor Labs’s new approach cuts 80% of the noise while providing actionable fix information that actually makes developers faster. 

The Endor Labs Supply Chain addresses three key pain points and outcomes:
Open Source Code Security: Endor Labs helps engineers improve application performance and minimize attack surface by selecting and maintaining secure &amp; high quality dependencies across the SDLC. Endor Labs replaces the existing breed of SCA solutions that lack context on code usage, thereby cutting ~80% of SCA noise so teams can focus on what matters.‍

CI/CD Pipeline Security: Endor Labs helps you discover pipelines and shadow engineering, ensure consistent security tool coverage, monitor the posture of repositories, and implement build integrity verification, all through a single hook and policy-as-code framework integrated into your pipeline.‍

Compliance &amp; SBOM: Endor Labs helps teams adhere to standards and regulations by detecting legal risk, generating and ingesting SBOMs/VEX, code signing, and align with NIST, SSDF, and CIS frameworks.

We help organizations from startups to Fortune 500, including VMWare, Edelman Financial Engines, and Five9. For more information, visit EndorLabs.com.
